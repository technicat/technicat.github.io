I skipped the [Game Developers Conference](http://gdconf.com/) this year to catch up on projects, so I missed the [International Game Developers Association](http://igda.org/) party and studio affiliates lunch. I didn’t mind missing the party - being crammed into a room full of sweaty game developers is too much like, well, game development. One of these days I’ll have to try the lunch, though it always seems like there’s too much up in the air to RSVP in time.

But I don’t pay the non-trivial studio affiliate fee just for party invites. The IGDA web site is a great free resource that deserves support - the industry white papers and [Jim Charne’s legal column](http://www.igda.org/columns/lastwords/) are easily worth several hours of billed consulting and legal fees, not to mention the forums (particularly the legal forum, in which many attorneys contribute their expertise). My only suggestion in those areas would be to upgrade the forum software (at least an RSS feed!), and for paying members (or at least small studio affiliates like mine) provide something like [Tom Buscaglia’s game attorney kit](http://www.gamedevkit.com/) as part of the membership.

The Quality of Life and Credit Standards efforts are also laudable, though I have some mixed feelings on those issues. The IGDA isn’t a union, so I expect much of those problems lie with IGDA members and those they want to cozy up to. For Credit Standards, it might be useful to leverage the membership to produce an online credit database. Mobygames is pretty cool, but it has a problem with disambiguating names. Last time I checked Mobygames, I was pleased to discover I’d worked on Soul Calibur. And if your last name is Smith, chances are you’ve got an improbably impressive credit list.

For the indie developer, though, the IGDA is sorely lacking support in one area - health insurance. This is an industry with high turnover, companies often disappearing after (or in the middle of) one project, unhealthy crunch times, many young workers who may not even understand the importance of health insurance, and many unprofessionally run companies that don’t know their obligations or don’t care.

I took employer-sponsored health insurance for granted until I went into games (or more generally, 3D interactive entertainment). When I left the first company and inquired about extending my insurance via [COBRA](http://www.dol.gov/dol/topic/health-plans/cobra.htm), no response until a letter from the insurer stating that since I hadn’t elected COBRA, my insurance was terminated. Which was inconvenient since my next employer didn’t provide insurance for the first month of any employee. At least they had a real HR rep who handled COBRA appropriately when I left them. For another game company that professed ignorance of COBRA - they thought they were fantastically generous in offering continuing coverage for departing employees. This place also handed out insurance application forms without the usual envelopes to seal them. Goodbye, medical privacy!

This is one area where the IGDA could take a cue from the [IEEE](http://ieee.org/). They offer group medical coverage, and also professional liability insurance for independent consultants and contractors, another product that would be really useful in the gamedev community, considering the number of freelancers. Speaking of which, I just saw a bit on the [Freelancers Union](http://freelancersunion.org/), which specializes on advocacy for freelancers, in addition to offering health insurance. I imagine a lot of freelances saw the same piece I did, on the News Hour with Jim Lehrer. Portions of the web site returned “too busy” when I checked it out. Freelancers unite!
