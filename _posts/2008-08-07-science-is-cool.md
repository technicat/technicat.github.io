Science is cool these days. I know this because it’s on TV - prime time, no less.

This first occurred to me when [Eureka](http://www.scifi.com/eureka/) went on the air, and again when it wasn’t cancelled. Somehow, the network that produces numerous cheap CG dragons and heavily promotes [Ghost Hunters](http://www.scifi.com/ghosthunters/) comes up with an occasional gem ([Battlestar Galactica](http://www.scifi.com/battlestar/)). But despite the name of the network, Eureka isn’t really sci-fi, it’s an hour-long science appreciation show. Geniuses living together in an isolated yet idyllic community, working on blue-sky projects while munching on free gourmet meals (sounds like a Google recruiting pitch). Not all are nerdy, but most are eccentric enough to fit in at Comic-con, and some are even good-looking, but not unbelievably so (at least with a slight stretch of imagination)

But there are other current shows which glamorize science, many of which involve crime, for some reason. Numbers, CSI, NCIS, Bones…to varying extents they all feature really techy people who are nerdy enough to assure us they must be really good at their stuff. [The Big Bang Theory](http://www.cbs.com/primetime/big_bang_theory/) wins the prize for the nerdiest cast of all, but despite that and the goofy intro song, it’s not nearly as awful as I expected, and it somehow still comes off as a celebration of nerdiness. As with the other shows, the science and nerd culture references sound accurate enough that you’d think there must be some ex-physics grad students on the writing staff. Versus standard sci-fi fare, all these shows let you say, “ah, that’s what a forensic examiner/physicist/mathematician does” (insert “good-looking” where appropriate)

And lest you think that the extreme displays of nerdiness don’t exit in real life, there’s [Beauty and the Geek](http://www.cwtv.com/shows/beauty-and-the-geek). (take the cast of The Big Bang Theory and parachute them into the Playboy mansion with [The Girls Next Door](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Girls_Next_Door), you get the idea) But if you want to see real scientific brains in action (“reality show” is an oxymoron, anyway), there’s a growing number of entertaining real science shows, like PBS’s [Wired Science](http://www.pbs.org/kcet/wiredscience/), and [ Nova Science Now  
](http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/sciencenow/) hosted by the energetic [Neil deGrasse Tyson.
