<p>I&rsquo;ve been an iPhone developer for about twenty months, now, and this is what it&rsquo;s cost me:
</p><ul><li>$99/year to register as an Apple developer (call it $200 total)</li>
	<li>$1500 for Unity iPhone plus $500 for the impending upgrade to Unity 3.0 ($2000 total)</li>
	<li>$100 for the <a href="http://stinkbot.com/">Unity iPhone Enhancement Pack</a></li>
	<li>$75 to place ads on <a href="http://appboy.com/">AppBoy</a></li>
	<li>$75 to commission a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5O7QDG12Fxc">promo video</a> fromÂ  <a href="http://slappapp.com/">SlapApp</a></li>
	<li>estimated $200 on iPhone development books (probably an underestimate - I&rsquo;m a bit embarrassed about how much I spend on books)</li>
	<li>$240 on a 2nd-gen iPod touch</li>
	<li>$500 on an iPad (this blog should be called the Cost of iPhone and iPad Development)</li>
	<li>$50 on iPhone/iPad accessories</li>
	<li>$30 on <a href="http://appviz.com/">AppViz</a> to track app sales</li>
	<li>$200 on iPhone and iPad apps</li>
</ul>
I omitted a lot of expenses that I arguably would have incurred, anyway, for example Unity iPhone is an add-on to Unity, so I spent $2000 on Unity Pro (again, $1500 and then $500 for the upgrade). And I&rsquo;m not counting my Mac hardware purchases (I&rsquo;ve gone through two MacBook Pro&rsquo;s, a couple of external drives, a monitor&hellip;). I am including everything iPhone and iPad related, because I&rsquo;m pretty sure I wouldn&rsquo;t have bought either one if I wasn&rsquo;t developing for them (I still use a Blackberry Pearl as my phone). I haven&rsquo;t bothered to calculate the sales tax - in California it&rsquo;s nearly 10% (consider making all your Apple hardware purchases in Oregon). As for marketing, I&rsquo;m only listing expenses on marketing specifically for my iPhone apps (specifically for <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/hyperbowl/id344209253?mt=8">HyperBowl</a>).

The final tally is $3500-$4000, let&rsquo;s say $4000 if I really have to pick a number, with the most going to <a href="http://unity3d.com/">Unity</a>, second most going to Apple, and the least going to marketing. That should probably change, especially since HyperBowl seems to be at a stage where it&rsquo;s getting predominantly five-star ratings from buyers, so features (or bugs) don&rsquo;t seem to be the obstacle to increased sales. And I&rsquo;m not in a hurry to push out the next version, which will involve a major conversion to Unity 3.0 (still in beta) and will be iPad and iOS4 only (as you can see, my hardware budget does not involve a plethora of test devices).

So far I&rsquo;ve just spent marketing money on sites where I feel the people are cool and deal with you fairly. I had a <a href="http://blog.appboy.com/2009/11/interview-philip-chu-they-dont-make-em-like-they-used-to/">developer interview on Appboy</a> and a <a href="http://www.slapapp.com/hyperbowl">HyperBowl review</a> and some promo code distributions on SlapApp before paying for their services. Contrast that to a site that recently asked me for a HyperBowl promo code so they could review it, and then after receiving a set of codes they asked me to pay for them to interview me and write a review. Yuck. And then there are many not quite so brazen that will ask you to pay for an &ldquo;expedited&rdquo; review. I know there are 200,000+ apps out there, but I&rsquo;d like to think there aren&rsquo;t that many desperate developers. I do have to admit, if Apple ever decided to auction off visibility on the App Store, they could make a mint off that. Actually, that sort of happens - if you&rsquo;re on the &ldquo;top grossing&rdquo; list, Apple&rsquo;s making out too.
