Appviz 2 stopped keeping up with App Store changes in the beginning of September, which is a few months after the end-of-life announced by the developer, so now I’m getting around to deleting it from my Mac. It’s a bit of a sentimental goodbye, much like when I finally got rid of my ‘94 Celica last year. Perhaps Appviz is similarly aged in software years - I’ve been using it to track the six years I’ve been on the App Store.

For now, I’m sticking with App Annie instead of trying the new web-based version of Appviz. But here’s a final screenshot for old time’s sake.
