<p>I started trying out CloudFlare a couple of days ago. It takes a day to see the resulting stats, so here are the initial results (I only have stats for my <a href="http://fugugames.com/">Fugu Games</a> site right now). Supposedly I should get a two-fold improvement in web access time - for now, I&rsquo;ll take their word for it. The graph looks nice and is somewhat interactive. Not a lot of detail, but it is successful in making me more paranoid about web attacks.</p>
