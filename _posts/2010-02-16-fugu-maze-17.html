<p>It&rsquo;s only been a week since the last <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=295808255&amp;mt=8">Fugu Maze</a> update, but I couldn&rsquo;t wait to add the photo picker from the Unity iPhone Enhancement Pack. Double-tap the screen, and you can paper the walls of your maze with baby photos or cat photos (at least, that&rsquo;s what I tested with).</p>

<p>To avoid confusion with the single-tap operation of the flashlight, I decided to just leave the flashlight on.</p>
