<p>One convenient thing about tumblr is they make it easy to customize the domain for your blog, which perhaps is a reason why so many sites use tumblr for their blog page (I’m thinking of sketchfab.com and itch.io, for example). The tumblr help doc isn’t quite complete, </p><p><a href="https://www.tumblr.com/docs/en/blog_management">https://www.tumblr.com/docs/en/blog_management</a></p><p>but as another testament to the popularity of this option, it seems every ISP tells you how to do it, for example GoDaddy:</p><p><a href="https://www.godaddy.com/help/configure-your-domain-with-tumblr-5413">https://www.godaddy.com/help/configure-your-domain-with-tumblr-5413</a><br/></p><p>and Google Domains:</p><p><a href="https://domains.google.com/registrar#chp=d,z&amp;d=fugugames.com&amp;z=a">https://domains.google.com/registrar#chp=d,z&amp;d=fugugames.com&amp;z=a</a><br/></p><p>compare this to Medium, which seems more grudging about it:</p><p><a href="https://help.medium.com/hc/en-us/articles/213474588">https://help.medium.com/hc/en-us/articles/213474588</a><br/></p>
