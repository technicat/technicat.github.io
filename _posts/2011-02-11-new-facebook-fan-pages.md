I went with an early upgrade for my [Facebook fan pages](http://facebook.com/hyperbowl) to the new format (which will take effect on all Facebok fan pages in March). I like the new format - it makes the fan page look like a user’s page and treats the fan page entity as a user, so fan page favorites are Likes and you can switch your identity to the fan page entity to invoke those Likes, see notifications of changes to the fan page, etc. It was getting difficult to figure out what you could do in a group page, fan page, user page…so this is an improvement. I think it looks better, too.
