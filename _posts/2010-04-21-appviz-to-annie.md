I mentioned in my previous post that itâ€™d like a way to import [AppViz](http://appviz.com/) data to AppAnnie, and the folks at [AppAnnie](http://appannie.com/) reminded me that AppViz has an export option, and AppAnnie imports it just fine. Unless you want to import a day at a time, export an archive, and import the resulting zip.
