<p>Putting together a hugely bad user interface is hard work - it requires painstaking assembly of numerous small bad interfaces. Recently, I received an email containing my World Market Rewards ID (are there any stores left where they you can just buy something without donating yourself to a database?) and a link to a confirmation page. In most online registrations, I can just click the link and I&rsquo;m done. Here, you have to enter the code they emailed you, but you can&rsquo;t even cut-and-paste it - the fields are separated so you have to type it in as if you&rsquo;re entering a serial number for Microsoft Windows. I&rsquo;m in no hurry to receive &ldquo;more special offers&rdquo;, so I&rsquo;ve let it sit, while they send me reminders to finish my registration.</p>
