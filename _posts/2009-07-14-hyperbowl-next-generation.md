Actually, by next generation I mean the current generation of game tech. The latest build of the [HyperBowl web player](http://www.hyperbowl3d.com/) uses some [Unity game engine](http://unity3d.com/) features not available in the original HyperBowl code circa 1999. Here’s a [YouTube video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fy2CeWXHm4s).

and some screenshots. Here’s bump-mapping:

and dynamic shadows:

and reflective/refractive water:
