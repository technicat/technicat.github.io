<p>It&rsquo;s not clear to me that issuing press releases results in increased <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/hyperbowl/id344209253?mt=8">HyperBowl</a> app sales, but there does seem to be a correlation between press releases and the number of <a href="http://facebook.com/hyperbowl">Facebook fans</a>. Looking at the Facebook Insights graph, the page starts out with just a handful of fans, then after a month it bumps up to fifty, probably when I decided to impose on a bunch of my Facebook fans (I refrained from blasting everyone on my friends list, but I sort of regret it now, since I can&rsquo;t remember to whom I&rsquo;ve sent fan invites). There was also a press release around that time, but I&rsquo;m not sure if that coincided with the jump. However, the two recent ascents do seem to coincide with the most recent two press releases. I can only speculate that my attempt at a media blitz does bring in new players of the<a href="http://hyperbowl3d.com/"> web player</a>.</p>
