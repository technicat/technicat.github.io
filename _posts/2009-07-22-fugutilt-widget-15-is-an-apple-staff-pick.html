<p><a href="http://www.apple.com/downloads/dashboard/games/fugutilt.html">FuguTilt</a> was the first Mac widget I listed on the <a href="http://www.apple.com/downloads/dashboard/">Apple download site</a>, and now with version 1.5 (the download page says 1.4 because I forgot to update that field), it&rsquo;s got a mention as a Staff Pick (which usually provides a big spike in downloads). Just goes to show, if you keep plugging away at it, someone will show some appreciation!</p>
