In an early episode of Human Target (I’m trying out a TV-viewing algorithm where I watch any show that was scored by Bear McReary), a minor twist in the plot is that the hacker the team is trying to identify turns out to be a woman (conveniently young and good-looking). The show creators apparently assume the audience also has a preconception that the hacker is male, but I don’t hold that against them - it’s rather clever, in fact. And people in the game industry are no better. I recently hear the phrase “pretty good for a girl” was uttered in the Unity forum, and was surprised to see women listed in the recent Game Developer “top” list, not because I didn’t recognize the names, but because they were absent in the previous (and staunchly defended) list. The new list could have been suffixed “Now with Women!”

So this is a case where television is more progressive than the game industry (is the bar that low?). It’s not for altruistic reasons - sometimes Hollywood does the right thing when they realize it provides more entertainment value for their broader audience. Now, I’m not a historian, but I’ve read enough to notice that women played a significant role in the history of computing, and I think there’s plenty of fodder for the studios.

For example, take [Countess Ada Lovelace](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ada_Lovelace). Charles Babbage is credited with designing the first computer, but he never got it running, while the Countess wrote programs for it, is considered the first computer programmer (the DoD language Ada is named after her), and she may well have been the brains behind the machine as well. Just from her name and title, I can see her biopic as Merchant Ivory production. Maybe with Keira Kneightly?

Another woman, also with a grandiose title, [Admiral Grace Hopper](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grace_hopper), is credited with coining the term “bug”. She doesn’t have a language named after her, but she does have a Navy destroyer with her name on it, and she did design a language, COBOL. You remember the Y2K panic about software systems that would fail at the turn of the millennium? That software was written in COBOL (and still around, maintained by creaky COBOL consultants). The story doesn’t sound like it has the romantic and melodramatic possibilities of Countess Ada Lovelace, but I think HBO could do something with her story (they did Truman, Stalin, and John Adams, after all).

And there are the unsung heroes. While reading a biography of Alan Turing, I learned that the building housing the team of women operating the code-breaking computers during WWII was so hot (foreshadowing the overheated server rooms of today), that the women would kick out the men so they could work in their underwear. Now, that’s made-for-TV right there - anywhere from the Lifetime Movie Network to Cinemax, depending how you want to play it.

In any case, highlighting their stories doesn’t just provide more role models, important as that is. It makes the history of computing more interesting and makes the industry more interesting. I wish these stories were in the textbook I used as a TA in a Computer Literacy course - then maybe I wouldn’t have had quite so many bored students just asking me for the answers to the next quiz.
