<p>I recently ran an installer that said &ldquo;This might take a moment.&rdquo; Which led me to wonder, how long is a moment? And if it doesn&rsquo;t take a moment, that means it&rsquo;s instantaneous? I&rsquo;ve see some other programs (and burueacracies) say &ldquo;This will take a few moments&rdquo;, which seems to indicate a moments are fixed quanta of time. I&rsquo;ve never seen anyone (or thing) say, &ldquo;This will take several moments&rdquo; or &ldquo;This will take lots and lots of moments&rdquo;, so based on experience watching progress indicators on the screen, you might think that a moment is actually a long time. But I checked the online Merriam-Webster dictionary, which supplies &ldquo;a minute portion of time&rdquo; or &ldquo;a comparatively brief period of time&rdquo;. So a lawyerly interpretation of &ldquo;this might take a moment&rdquo; could actually be &ldquo;this could take a little time, if you&rsquo;re lucky&rdquo;.</p>
