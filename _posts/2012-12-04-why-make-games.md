There’s no shortage of reasons to make games. Do what you love, supposedly it’s a huge business where you can rake in the money (I did say supposedly), it’s sexier than writing accounting software, you can register for professional passes at E3 and Comic Con, yada yada… But one practical incentive I’ve found to make games is that it’s easier to get them through the App Store approval gauntlet. I can’t think of any apps I’ve had rejected from the App Store when submitted in the Games category, aside from the occasional technical issue. I might be shooting just around 50/50 in all other categories, though, with rejections like:

- Primarily a book (when submitting to the Books category).
- Consisting largely of web content (I could say the same of the Facebook app).
- Largely promotional (for a local restaurant I frequent - urm, what about that Pizza Hut app?)
- Not enough functionality (I should have added Game Center integration and changed the category to Games)
So my inspiring advice is, make games because they’ll let you.
