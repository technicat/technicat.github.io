Apple&rsquo;s retiring the original TestFlight and pushing everyone into their new incarnation (which doesn&rsquo;t really resemble the old version, so why did they acquire TestFlight except to shut it down?), so I&rsquo;m dragging WordsEye iOS testers into the new system. No longer having to generate new provisioning profiles every time a new user signs up is a big win for me, and the 1000-user limit is a lot better than the 100 ad-hoc test device limit. But there are some inconveniences with the new system: Apple approval for each new build (so far, it&rsquo;s only taken a day for each, but still&hellip;), 30-day build expiration, having to deactivate the previous build while waiting for the new one to get approved, testers have to accept the invitation from within the Apple iOS Mail program (vs. GMail fo rexample), and one of my testers was having images, including the Open in TestFlight img tag, filtered out by their university mail system. Besides all that, it works great.</p>
