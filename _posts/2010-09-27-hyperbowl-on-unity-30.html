<p>I submitted HyperBowl on a <a href="http://unity3d.com/">Unity 3.0</a> release candidate this weekend, so I thought I could take a break from Unity until the final release. But that came today (while I was searching futility for the strawberries in my Fresh&amp;Easy strawberry rice crispy cereal - cruel disappointment), so time to get cracking on that web player. In the meantime, here&rsquo;s a screenshot of the newly-added San Francisco lane from the submitted app, looking fine in HD on my 4th-gen iPod touch:</p>
