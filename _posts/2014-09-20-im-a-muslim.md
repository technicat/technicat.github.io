I seem to end up in a lot of conversations that unexpectedly turn to Barack Obama. Just this past week, a conversation about real estate turned into “You know, Obama’s a Muslim.”

Normally, I try to just sidle away at this point, but she explained “His father’s a Muslim, and Muslims consider Obama a Muslim.”

Thus, I felt obligated to inform her that, by that reasoning, I’m a Muslim, too, since I’m descended from Muslims on my father’s side.

“But you’re not a terrorist, right?”

Now, first of all, I’m not a Muslim. And, no, I’m not a terrorist (first time I’ve been asked that, but I’m sure it’ll be on the TSA questionnaire one of these days). Anyway, who cares who’s a Muslim? And wait, did you just say Obama’s a terrorist? Also, if you think someone’s a Muslim because Muslims think he’s a Muslim, doesn’t that make you a Muslim? This is what happens when you follow a train wreck of thought.

But good news, people. to my surprise, I may be a Muslim, but (not to my surprise) I’m not a terrorist. And now, back to our regular programming.
