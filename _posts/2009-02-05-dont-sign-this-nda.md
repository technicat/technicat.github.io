While cleaning out some old files, I found this NDA I received from some Caltech grads starting up a mobile game company. The NDA was pretty standard except for this last clause stating that I agreed to any future version of the NDA, whether or not I agreed to it. When I tried to explain no sane person would sign this, the guy gave some standard “our lawyer drafted this to protect our company’s interests” and then hung up on me. This is why I don’t look for projects on [Craig’s List](http://craigslist.org/), anymore.
