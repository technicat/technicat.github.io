<p>I was miffed enough about Goodread&rsquo;s revised terms of servce, particularly the expanded indemfnification clause, that I sent them a complaint. After a few days, I received a reply:
</p><blockquote>Thanks very much for contacting us with that question.  Let me first say that I understand your concern, and that we debated with this exact point when creating the terms.  Our lawyers recommended it however, and it is standard practice for free media sites to have a general indemnification clause.  Sites like Facebook, MySpace, Flixster, and many more all have similar clauses.  However I recognize that the &ldquo;me too&rdquo; excuse is not a good one.  We honestly could have gone either way on the clause, but felt it was better to be safe and have our users trust our judgement should any unforeseen legal issues arise.  Just as we have a reputation to uphold in the way we do business, so we have a reputation to upload in the way we treat our members - and that includes doing the right thing in any legal matters.

I hope this addresses your concerns, and feel free to respond - we have core belief in listening to feedback from members.</blockquote>
I appreciate getting a response, but (as I in turn responded to them), &ldquo;trust us&rdquo; isn&rsquo;t much better than &ldquo;me too&rdquo;,  and there are sites that have narrower or even no indemnfication clause, including Twitter, Facebook (despite what they said), Travelocity&hellip; It is hard to completely avoid these terms - Google uses them - but I like to mount feeble protests when I can, and my usage of Goodreads is pretty weak (I just use it to track the books I&rsquo;ve read and rate them - I don&rsquo;t bother writing reviews). So, looks like it&rsquo;s goodbye, Goodreads&hellip;
