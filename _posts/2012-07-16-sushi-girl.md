In past Comic Cons, I’ve only glanced in on the film showings in the Marriott - usually it’s just one of the Star Trek movies playing. So this time I completely forgot about it on the first day, and dropped in as an afterthought when I went to get some free soda and chips in the Con Lounge on the second. And Star Trek:Wrath of Con was playing.

But then I dropped in again an hour later (after getting more soda and chips), and caught a good portion of [The Collectibles](http://www.the-collectibles.com/), which was amusing.

After catching a couple of panels (digital comic distribution, Defiance), decided it was dinnertime, meaning more soda and chips, wandered into the film room, and wow, the room was pretty full, and they were watching a real new movie, Sushi Girl, which had a real Tarantino vibe, but with more skin (come to think of it, there’s not much skin in Tarantino movies - only Bridget Fonda’s butt comes to mind). And when the lights went up, the filmmakers and much of the cast were there for Q&A, including Tony Todd (I’ll forever remember him a the Candyman). They got a standing ovation. In retrospect, the plot didn’t make a lot of sense, but Mark Hamill, Michael Biehn, Danny Trejo…that’s a pretty cool lineup.
