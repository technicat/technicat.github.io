> ## **Nintendo explains why we only got the New 3DS XL&nbsp;⊟**
> 
> Nintendo of America’s Damon Baker explained the company’s decision not to release the standard New 3DS — in all its custom cover plate and Super Famicom-style button glory — to the U.S. in [a recent Nintendo Life interview](http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2015/02/interview_nintendos_damon_baker_on_the_eshop_team_reaching_out_to_indies_and_finding_games_that_matter).
> 
> What it comes down to, whether you agree with its argument or not, is that Nintendo of America doesn’t want to confuse consumers by providing too many options that aren’t differentiated enough from each other in terms of pricing and features. So for now we get non-[Kawaii New 3DSes](http://tinycartridge.com/post/103665029742/my-new-3ds-is-too-kawaii-now-a-bunch-of-you-on)..&nbsp;
