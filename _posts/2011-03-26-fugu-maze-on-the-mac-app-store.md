Perhaps simpler is better. [Fugu Maze](http://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=426993175&mt=12) just got approved on the Mac App Store after about a week in the queue and a day or so of preparation (I hadn’t touched the non-iOS version for at least a year, so it required some dusting off). Meanwhile, [HyperBowl](http://hyperbowl3d.com/) has been rejected three times, after submitting it six weeks ago, and after two months of preparation. Ah, well, maybe fourth time’s the charm.
