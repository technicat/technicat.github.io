<p>Recently, my AppAnnie reports have indicated increased sales in Brazil and China, and this AppViz graph does show them as my biggest markets after the US (along with France)</p>

<p>But the graph for revenue shows a different story. When it comes to paying customers (as opposed to just downloading the free apps), it&rsquo;s USA, baby! (And my thanks to second place Australia)</p>
