<p>I was pleasantly startled to find that my <a href="http://www.mobygames.com/developer/sheet/view/developerId,130887/">MobyGames listing</a> includes a credit for Soul Calibur IV. Much as I&rsquo;d like to associate myself with that series, it&rsquo;s another Philip Chu. Turns out my alter ego is the conductor of the Eminence Symphony Orchestra, which specializes in performing video game music.</p>
