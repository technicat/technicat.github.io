I have some fond memories of Baltimore, where I worked on space telescopes and submarine simulators, was introduced to crab cakes and the bars of Fells Point, got my masters degree and bailed out of a PhD program at Johns Hopkins. So, despite my turn away from academia, I’m pleased to see a course on [Interface Design for Games](http://interfacedesignforgames.blogspot.com/2010/01/week-1.html) at the University of Baltimore listing my [essay on UI design](http://technicat.com/writing/ui.html).&nbsp; This is the second time I’ve seen one my essays used in a course (the other one is on [programming habits](http://technicat.com/writing/programming.html) ) - if this keeps up, maybe I’ll put together a book!
