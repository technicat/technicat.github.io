While I decided to dispense with Google Ads for now, I’m still leaving an ad-space-for-rent on my [Technicat](http://technicat.com/) site. I’m not terribly interested in advertising as a business model, but I receive inquiries from ad brokers (or adbots - they tend to have odd names and never have the courtesy to reply when I politely decline), so just so I don’t have to tell them I don’t have any advertising spots available, I’ll now direct them to the space on the left:

I went with AdvertiseSpace out of convenience, since I just bought a bunch of ads through them for [HyperBowl](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/hyperbowl/id344209253?mt=8). They don’t have the performance tracking features of BuySellAds, but the latter has a long list of “criteria/suggestions” for site approval, including 100,000+ impressions per month. Based on my Google Ad experiment, I’m just getting 3,000 (nothwithstanding the once-every-three-year flurry I get from digg or reddit). But then again, based on the Google results I should charge $3/month. I’m charging a lot more, so I don’t expect to sell the spot, but hey, all it takes is one.
