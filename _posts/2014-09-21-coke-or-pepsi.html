<p>I prefer Pepsi over Coke, but it&rsquo;s not a strong preference. It&rsquo;s such a weak preference, in fact, that I usually order Coke because it&rsquo;s easier to say.</p>

<p>In Hong Kong, though, I found the opposite situation. Coke is:</p>

<p>可口可樂</p>

<p>which is more or less a Cantonese phonetic version of  &quot;Coca Cola,&ldquo;  pronounced something like &quot;ho low ho loc.&rdquo; And make sure each syllable is pronounced with the correct one of six Cantonese tones (or nine, depending who&rsquo;s counting).</p>

<p>Pepsi, on the other hand is:</p>

<p>百事</p>

<p>and pronounced &ldquo;batsi&rdquo; (sort of rhymes with &ldquo;yahtzee&rdquo;).</p>

<p>In six months in Hong Kong, I was never able to order Coke correctly on the first try (or even the third). I was an ace at ordering Pepsi, though.</p>
