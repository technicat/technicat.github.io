<p>This weekend&rsquo;s Korean drama marathon: City Hunter. Good action, romance, humor (but not slapstick), and a pretty good plot. The soundtrack is excellent, especially in the action sequences:</p>



<p>It&rsquo;s got a Batman vibe, but this hero&rsquo;s girlfriend can kick ass and isn&rsquo;t too obtuse to eventually figure out Clark Kent is Superman (OK, I&rsquo;m mixing my superhero comparisons)</p>
