I was talking to someone about user interfaces today and mentioned some of my favorite books on the subject. I might as well share them with everyone:

Apple Human Interface Guidelines (it’s actually kind of a mess compared to the original one-volume Mac guidelines, but still…)&nbsp;[http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/AppleHIGuidelines/HIPrinciples/HIPrinciples.html#//apple\_ref/doc/uid/TP30000353-TP6](http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/AppleHIGuidelines/HIPrinciples/HIPrinciples.html%23//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000353-TP6)

[http://www.designinginteractions.com/](http://www.designinginteractions.com/)&nbsp;Cool stuff like how the guy who made the Palm walked around with a small slab in his shirt pocket and pretended to use it as PDA as a simulation.

[http://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/](http://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/)&nbsp;Really interesting principles and ways to visualize data - it actually got me interested in data visualization. And looks good on coffee tables.

[http://www.jnd.org/books/the-design-of-everyday-things.html](http://www.jnd.org/books/the-design-of-everyday-things.html) This really made me think about product design (“yeah, the VCR, what’s up with that?”)
