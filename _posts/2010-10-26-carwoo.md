My first car lasted about eight years and eight-eight thousand miles. I’m still on my second car, which has lasted nearly twice as long so far, fourteen years and 150,000 miles, and it’s still going. That’s largely because I’m not driving it through New England snow and salt like I did my first car, but it’s also because I dread another trip to a car dealer. The guys who sold me my ‘94 Celica haggled with me so long and with so many people they forgot what they were asking for and accidentally dropped their price $400.

So next time around, I may try something different, like the sales services offered by AAA or my credit union. But this service from a YCombinator startup looks interesting.
