I have a lot of email addresses that I create for different occasions so when I get spam I can deduce where the spammers got my address. It’s also handy when those unsubscribe links don’t work - I just remove the address from service.

For example, last week I decided to remove resume@technicat.com from service, again. It’s only listed on a resume I created several years ago - now it’s in a bunch of recruiter databases and I get hilarious or irritating emails (depending on my mood) in the nature of “Your resume looks great, can you send me your resume” and even “what is your email.” A recruiter I had an email exchange with a month ago just reintroduced himself: “Hi, may name is…” And there are always the “Do you know someone who could fill this position?” Sure, just give me ten percent of his or her salary.

I’m more sad that I have to remove comicon@technicat.com. I don’t get too much junk email from comicon, compared to other conventions, but Random House Audio is one of those that just don’t want to go away. I’ve hit the unsubscribe link on each of their messages - now they just mention they have an unsubscribe page and you have to guess where it its:
