<p>When I left New Jersey, I left behind the $200 &ldquo;smart&rdquo; scale I got from the Apple Store. Now I live near a Bed Bath and Beyond which stocks a much cheaper ($50) scale from Weight Gurus that also uploads data that is synced to an Android or iOS app. The app is not quite as good as the other one - the UI is a bit clunkier and I can&rsquo;t figure out how to refresh the data without restarting the app. And the scale doesn&rsquo;t feature some of the bizarre readings the other one did, like room temperature, or automatically upload data to your account and devices.</p>

<p>But the syncing is clever - as the readings display, start the app and aim the camera at the scale to read a barcode. That is a big awkward as you have to remember to take your phone when you weigh yourself, but it&rsquo;s one of those inconveniently cool things.</p>
