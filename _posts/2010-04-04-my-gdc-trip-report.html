<p>I&rsquo;m a proponent of trip reports. They force you to think about what you saw at the conference, the company gets more for their money if you disseminate the information, and it will allay your coworkers&rsquo; suspicions that you spent the whole time partying.</p>

<p>Since I&rsquo;m self-employed and paid my own way, and I didn&rsquo;t really spend much time at <a href="http://gdconf.com/">GDC</a>, it&rsquo;s not quite so useful for me to give a trip report, but I&rsquo;ll do it anyway.</p>

<p>First, let&rsquo;s get the conference part out of the way. I primarily went there to network and had a nice dinner in Chinatown with developers from my client (<a href="http://avatar-reality.com/">Avatar Reality</a>, the developer of the virtual world <a href="http://bluemars.com/">Blue Mar</a>s) and a croissant with the head of the charity <a href="http://get-well-gamers.org/">Get Well Gamers</a>.</p>

<p>I only went to the expo for a few hours, and I will repeat my annual complaint that CMP is really milking the event, selling only a three-day expo pass for $250, and it was an unpleasant surprise to find they were not accepting <a href="http://igda.org/">IGDA</a> discounts for on-site registration (the people at the desk didn&rsquo;t seem to know what IGDA was). I stopped by the IGDA booth and they seemed surprised, too. I generally don&rsquo;t consider splurging for the whole conference package because, 1) I tend to fall asleep in talks and 2) again they&rsquo;re milking it, charging separately for the &ldquo;Mobile Summit&rdquo;, etc. I remember in my dot-com days that Java One was expensive, too, but once you paid for it, you got the whole conference.</p>

<p>The expo seemed smaller than the last time I went two years ago, and I wouldn&rsquo;t say there&rsquo;s a lot new, except two of the middleware packages I use, <a href="http://unity3d.com/">Unity</a> and <a href="http://scaleform.com/">Scaleform</a> had more sizeable presences than two years ago, and their reps looked really busy. At the Unity booth, I had a nice talk with the <a href="http://dimerocker.com/">dimeRocker</a> folks and fellow Unity developer Jonathan Czeck of <a href="http://www.graveck.com/">Graveck</a> (it&rsquo;s always fun talking to other engineers - with marketing, it&rsquo;s a toss-up, sometimes they&rsquo;re cool, sometimes they stand there looking bored until someone with an expensive suit shows up). Aside from that, noticed there were a lot of companies offering virtual currency solutions and a pretty cool VR input device that resembled a giant hamster ball.</p>

<p>Aside from that, I eschewed the parties (my return flight seemed to full of hung-over game developers) and checked out the town. Some observations: <a href="http://citylights.com/">City Lights Bookstore</a> is a pretty nice bookstore - it doesn&rsquo;t seem to have any computer books, but there&rsquo;s a decent sci-fi section. The Crocker Galleria isn&rsquo;t what it used to be, apparently hit hard by the doldrums of the Financial District. Beard Papa Sweets are tasty. So was the chocolate place next door. Considering the frequency of rain in San Francisco, you&rsquo;d think some place around the Moscone would sell umbrellas. Smoking is prevalent - get caught walking behind a smoker and you&rsquo;ll get a lungful. The <a href="http://www.mocfa.org/">Museum of Crafts and Folk Art</a> is small, but it&rsquo;s got a cool gift shop (some carving are from an astrophysics grad student in Arizona). Food in San Francisco is expensive. The <a href="http://filoli.org/">Filoli Gardens</a> is amazing. Joy Luck Place in San Mateo has excellent dim sum (I hear Martin Yan of Yan Can Cook goes there). <a href="http://hyperbowl3d.com/">HyperBowl</a> is back in the Metreon and in excellent condition, although it costs $5 per play. Every block in San Francisco, you&rsquo;ll see Asian faces - yet in Monk, one of my favorite San Francisco shows, I only recall seeing Asians as a laundress and Chinatown gang members. I don&rsquo;t know if I saw any Chinatown gang members, but I did see a lot of tourists and touristy shops. I have to admit, I bought some touristy stuff - a fan and an abacus. It&rsquo;s research (think iPhone/iPad appÂ  - I&rsquo;m serious!).</p>
