> You might think our planet has **a uniform gravitational field** - but you’d be wrong! There’s actually quite a bit of variation (though at such small scales we’d never be able to feel it). Using a suite of satellites, the people at the [German Research Center for Geosciences](http://www.gfz-potsdam.de/en/media-communication/image-galleries/geoid-the-potsdam-gravity-potato/) created this **“Gravity Potato” map** of the earth. Red areas that swell outwards = higher gravity. Bluer areas that dip inward = lower gravity.
