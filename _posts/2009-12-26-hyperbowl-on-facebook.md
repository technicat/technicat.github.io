Personally, I avoid Facebook apps since they usually have obnoxious or deceptive ads, and I don’t really trust the apps, either. But from what I’ve read and all the Mafia Wars wall posts of my Facebook friends, it’s a game platform that shouldn’t be ignored. Conveniently, dimerocker started a closed beta of their platform supporting Facebook Unity games, which saves me a whole bunch of work setting up my own server-side infrastructure and figuring out how to make money on it (i.e. getting ads). I tried it out Christmas Eve and in less than two hours got HyperBowl up and running as a [Facebook app](http://apps.facebook.com/hyperbowl). It looks promising - if all goes well, I’ll add more lanes and use the dimerocker API for leaderboards and such.
