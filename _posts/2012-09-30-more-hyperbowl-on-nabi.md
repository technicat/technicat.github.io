A while ago I placed HyperBowl on the Nabi tablet for $.99, but as with other Android app stores, it doesn’t seem like people there want to pay for apps, so now HyperBowl Lite is there. Since the tablet is targeted to kids, I didn’t really want to do that, but on the other hand, it’s probably safer in that respect than in in-app purchase system. Oh, well, what can you do…
