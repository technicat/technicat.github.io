The [HyperBowl Rome](http://itunes.com/app/hyperbowlrome) 1.1 update is on the App Store - approved in less than a week!

It’s interesting to see the App Store now automatically lists the “Updated” date. So, thankfully, no more trying to game the system by manually adjusting the Release date with each update. It’s also interesting to see the Update date is actually tomorrow. That should address another problem - I used to set the Release date as soon as I got the app approval notice, but then it would be buried by all the app that already showed up that day. Maybe this will give it a little more visibility. Still, there’s not much visibility overall to recent updates/releases, unless you score a New and Noteworthy listing by Apple. One can hope.
