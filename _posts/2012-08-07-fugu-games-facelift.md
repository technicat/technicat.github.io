I went into PHP mode again this weekend and added icons to table of apps. The icons do make it prettier.

But I decided I really need to just redo the page, again, since it just doesn’t look good when viewed from a small screen, especially in portrait orientation, and I need a “more games” type of presentation for linking from apps. So I reuse the icon table, and I have alternate views for showing apps in different appstores (nook, kindle, google plah). It still links to the old table - I like to see those bar charts!
