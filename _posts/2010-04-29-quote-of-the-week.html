<p>In the midst of a rant conflating drug cartels with job loss, KTLA&rsquo;s version of the angry white man radio show had this response to the argument that requiring local police to actively enforce immigration laws will reduce reporting of crime by illegal immigrants:

</p><blockquote>&ldquo;Illegal alien criminals victimize mostly illegal aliens so illegal aliens should be glad to see illegal aliens driven from their neighborhood, particularly the criminals.&rdquo;</blockquote>

This is from memory, so the wording might not be exact, but I&rsquo;m pretty sure the idiocy is intact. I generally don&rsquo;t find radio talk shows appealing so I only caught this because KTLA invited these deep thinkers to give their opinions on the broadcast news, and lest you think it an aberration, KTLA has been promoting the radio show with an excerpt about &ldquo;illegal-lovin&rdquo; something or other. It&rsquo;s not even a complete sentence, which is out-of-context even for an out-of-context business, but I guess they just wanted to emphasize the fun words. At least they haven&rsquo;t followed the CNN path of making them news anchors. Yet.
