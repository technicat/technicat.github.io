<p>Marketing isn&rsquo;t rocket science, at least the way I&rsquo;m doing it. For example, occasionally I try the tactic of temporarily making an app free. That definitely attracts attention, since many sites track price changes (google your app 24 hours after making it free and you&rsquo;ll find a dozen sites linking to it). Yesterday the promotion garnered 8000 downloads.

But I&rsquo;ve had mixed success in terms of boosting sales (in particular for the full <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/hyperbowl/id344209253?mt=8">HyperBowl</a> app ) . My theory is that the free app crowd is largely distinct from the paying app crowd. Also, the freeloaders will drag down your ratings. For example, a couple of days ago, I made <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/hyperbowl-rome/id335726584?mt=8">HyperBowl Rome</a> free. Up til then, it had 3-5 star ratings and now the French are piling on with 1-star reviews. (Although there is one good French review out of the three. And by the way, Japan has also been rough on me overall on my apps, but Germany has been nice and the US is actually in the middle). Here&rsquo;s the AppViz summary:

<a href="http://itshardtofondlepenguins.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Screen-shot-2010-08-16-at-9.53.45-AM.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3732" title="Screen shot 2010-08-16 at 9.53.45 AM" src="http://itshardtofondlepenguins.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Screen-shot-2010-08-16-at-9.53.45-AM.png" alt="" width="747" height="395"/></a>

Normally, I end the promotion as soon as I get an obnoxious review that really bugs me. But I don&rsquo;t actually see foreign reviews on the US App Store, and I don&rsquo;t understand them until I run them through google translate, and then more often than not, it&rsquo;s entertaining. Like this:
</p><blockquote>A big  stew as we see often unplayable and ugly, without interest unless you  like never score any points, as is the case, it is always out of time or  if you love smash the screen of your device rubbing to death this game is for you, can even pad three feet below the ankle of dark nebula. TO AVOID!</blockquote>
So I guess I&rsquo;ll let it run for a little while longer.
