I was recently approached by a publisher about preparing a Korean version of [HyperBowl for Android](https://market.android.com/details?id=com.technicat.HyperBowl), so I looked into localization packages for Unity. There’s a free one listed somewhere on the Unity forum and at least a few on the Asset Store - I settled on the [M2H Localization Package](http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=5&ved=0CDoQFjAE&url=http%3A%2F%2Fu3d.as%2F1Ya&ei=A2DcTum6CILMiQKil4yFCg&usg=AFQjCNGV5Ex2kwj8STkH-LEoxTmJbIjkTQ). It’s got a pretty cool Google Docs feature, where you can have Google Translate fill in spreadsheet entries and then download that into your Unity project with a button click. Leaving translations up to Google Translate is a bit risky, but the good people of La Petite Baguette went over the French translation with me and it turns out Google Translate did a passable job. I also updated [HyperBowl on the App Store](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/hyperbowl/id344209253) with this new language support (iOS has many more selectable languages than my Samsung Galaxy Vibrant) - so far I’ve got French, German, Korean and Japanese.
