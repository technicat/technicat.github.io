[![Xcode 6 Essentials](https://d.gr-assets.com/books/1423764400m/24919658.jpg)](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24919658-xcode-6-essentials)[Xcode 6 Essentials](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24919658-xcode-6-essentials) by [Jayant Varma](https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/6829358.Jayant_Varma)  
My rating: [4 of 5 stars](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1239831910)  
  
The title of this book should be something like Xcode 5 Essentials with Swift, as it uses Swift exclusively with no Objective-C. I don’t see that necessarily as a drawback, since there are plenty of books on Objective-C and Swift is the new kid on the block and arguably a better choice for new iOS developers (it’s debatable - Swift is still somewhat experimental and under development, as indicated by the appendix with late-breaking Swift changes, while there’s a lot of legacy Objective-C).  
  
The bigger problem with this book is poor editing. There are some clear grammatical errors and typos and awkward phrasing that make some passages tedious to get through and understand. I might have wondered if there was any editing at all, except one paragraph oddly uses the greek beta letter to refer to beta software, which seems like the type of edit a non-techie editor might make (but not consistently - one sentence has both Greek beta and beta beta).  
  
The author seems to warm up after the intro chapters - I’m not sure if the writing gets better or the material gets more interesting. Probably some of both, and in any case his enthusiasm for the material is evident. The introduction to Swift is pretty good, and the step by step examples are thorough, although sometimes I had trouble figuring out what part of Xcode the author is referring to (again, some rephrasing or properly used comma would make a big difference).  
  
Also, I prefer to code as much as possible in code without using a GUI to implement GUIs (the tutorial step asking you to create four identical view controllers is an example where pure coding would actually be simpler than all that dragging and dropping). But I understand the emphasis of this book is on Xcode and its features including the storyboards and Interface Builder. There is also some cursory instruction on how to create custom controls and add gesture recognizers and some welcome comprehensive details on debugging, more than I’ve seen in other books. I also didn’t know that you can use the Interface Builder to create animated launch screens. So I’d have to say this is a fairly useful book and would benefit from a later edition with improved editing and a more finalized Swift specification.
