<p>Upon recommendation from a <a href="http://unity3d.com/">Unit</a>y forum thread on the vagaries of iPhone memory usage, I went looking for an app called Free Memory. I couldn&rsquo;t find it, or didn&rsquo;t bother to find it, in the pile of search results, victim of all the apps with &ldquo;free&rdquo; in their names or perhaps the fact there are now over 100,000 apps in the store. (can anyone say &ldquo;gold rush&rdquo;?)</p>

<p>Instead I settled for an app called Memory Status. The following two screens should give you an idea why big apps or even unlucky small apps can crash. Even though you&rsquo;re running one app at a time, there&rsquo;s other stuff still running, and after a while your available pool of memory (inactive+free) shrinks and shrinks. Tapping the little info icons gives you a brief description of each category of memory state.</p>

<p>This is the part that is supposed to make you feel like you&rsquo;re back in control. The interface looks pretty polished, with those icons at top bobbing up and down, which I guess indicates they&rsquo;re getting cleaned. Hard to tell exactly what&rsquo;s going on, though, since while they&rsquo;re bobbing I can tap on the broom and vacuum cleaner icons repeatedly to cancel/start a clean.</p>

<p>But looks like it did something. Switching back to the memory view (and hitting the refresh button at top right - I&rsquo;m surprised I have to do that - shouldn&rsquo;t it refresh when I&rsquo;m switching back to this view?), looks like I got a whole boatload of memory back. Next time I run low on memory I&rsquo;ll probably still just reboot - I doubt any tool can clean better than that - but I think this will still be useful for checking, well, memory status. Good name.</p>
