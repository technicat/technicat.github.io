The [App Store](http://www.apple.com/iphone/appstore/) seems to&nbsp;&nbsp;provide the advantages of console programming (target fixed hardware) along with a convenient&nbsp;way to self-publish. But each submission is subject to Apple approval. I haven’t heard of too many rejections, but I have heard of a few, and I got my first one recently. After silence on the approval front over several weeks, this little demo of mocap from [ElektraShock](http://www.elektrashock.com/) got rejected for “not providing enough user functionality”.

Getting started on [iPhone software development](http://developer.apple.com/iphone/program/) compares favorably to the ordeal of console development (check out the [Wii developer requirements](http://www.warioworld.com/apply/)) But there is no App Store equivalent to the concept approval element of console projects, so you run the risk of investing a lot into an app that Apple ultimately rejects. (not that I put a lot of work into this one - it’s a vastly trimmed down version of a browser demo on [Fugu Games](http://www.fugugames.com/))
