[HyperBowl](http://hyperbowl3d.com/) originally debuted in the Metreon (the Sony Metreon back then) ten years ago but I heard it had been removed a few years ago, and I don’t recall seeing it during GDC 2008. But at last week’s GDC, I wandered up there and there they were. Looking good, too (don’t be fooled by the awful quality of my cell phone photos). This is the original concept - to emulate the feel of a real bowling alley.
