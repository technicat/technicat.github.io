<p>Well, this brings back memories. I was going to reminisce about how the C64 was one of the first computers I learned to program, but I think it was actually the Commodore PET and typing in a Star Trek BASIC game while watching the cassette deck get stuck in the Iowa summer heat doesn&rsquo;t really qualify as programming. Nonetheless, this looks cool. What are the chances we&rsquo;ll see an Apple II on the iPhone?</p>
