Hooray, no more presidential campaign coverage for me, now that I sent in my vote-by-mail ballot. Now I return to watching recycled sitcoms during the news hours, satisfied that I have intelligently cast my votes after googling all the candidates. Local races are still a problem, though, so initially, I considered just voting for anyone who actually had a web site (hey, it’s an improvement over my previous tactic of just guessing or leaving the whole slate blank). But some web sites are worse than none. The site of [John Briscoe](http://johnbriscoe.com/) could be a candidate for [Web Sites That Suck](http://websitesthatsuck.com/):

The full extent of this site’s awfulness is not conveyed in the screenshot. The blue New graphic rotates, the arrow graphic wiggles horizontally, and the grey splotches are flashing “New” graphics reminiscent of the notorious blink tag. To top it off, the issue statements are only viewable with the Windows Media Player.
