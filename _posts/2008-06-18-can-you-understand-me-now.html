<p>In the heated competition among phone companies to see who can come up with the most annoying television ad (Verizon&rsquo;s &ldquo;can you hear me now?&rdquo; is the reigning champ), AT&amp;T has come along with a spot showing a business deal in Hong Kong botched due to misspoken Chinese. Ironically, after the offended businessmen stalk off muttering in Cantonese, the smug narrator not only says goodbye in Mandarin, but botches the pronunciation horribly (it&rsquo;s as if someone said &ldquo;goo-goo&rdquo; to you instead of &ldquo;goodbye&rdquo; - you might get the idea if he&rsquo;s waving). And Cantonese, while usually considered a dialect of Chinese, is actually different enough from Mandarin that it&rsquo;s sometimes considered a separate language. Mixing the two is like, perhaps, mixing Spanish and Portuguese.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s par for the course for your everyday Joe, and not just Americans. Although my mother tongue is Cantonese (or would be, if I could remember it), there was a Korean grocer in Playa Del Rey who would give me the Mandarin salutation ni-hao-ma and then stare at me expectantly, until I moved. But AT&amp;T is a global telcom - don&rsquo;t they have anyone on staff who knows there&rsquo;s more than one <a href="http://www.glossika.com/en/dict/faq.php">Chinese dialect</a>? And can tell when one of them has been butchered? I mean, at least check the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spoken_Chinese">Wikipedia entry</a>.</p>
