<p>I just tried out the <a href="http://pixelplacement.com/2010/11/14/doc-search-for-unity/">doc search Unity add-on</a> from pixelplacement. It&rsquo;s not as world-changing as iTween, but it&rsquo;s one of those tools that removes a constant annoyance. Whenever I want to look up a Unity script function, I have to go to the Unity help menu, select Script Reference, then perform a search. This lets me perform the search within Unity. It only saves me one step, but ifÂ  you count the total original operations as two steps, that&rsquo;s 2X improvement! And bonus, you can specify whether you want to search locally or on the web, and while the Unity Help menu only searches locally, I&rsquo;d rather search on the web, since half the time I&rsquo;m searching for a link to pass it on to someone else.</p>
