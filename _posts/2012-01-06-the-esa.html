<p>I googled for the <a href="http://theesa.com/">ESA web site</a> just now, and found it at &ldquo;theesa.com&rdquo;, even the top search result was the <a href="http://esa.int/">European Space Agency.</a> So wouldn&rsquo;t &ldquo;anesa.com&rdquo; be more accurate and less grandiose? (video games are cool, but c'mon, compared to space exploration?)</p>

<p>The ESA has most recently been in the news for its support of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stop_Online_Piracy_Act">SOPA</a>. I&rsquo;m not an expert on SOPA, and I&rsquo;m not pro-piracy. It seems like no big deal until you see your own stuff pirated on some site that&rsquo;s getting income from ads, claiming it&rsquo;s providing a public service to &ldquo;try before you buy&rdquo;, yet not providing links for legitimage purchases - then its just irritating. And be honest - downloading a thousand cracked apps and then paying for a few, is not try-before-you-buy, it&rsquo;s steal-then-pay-for-a-couple-so-you-can-say-you&rsquo;re-not-stealing. However, among other issues, SOPA seems suspect on due process, and we have little enough of that already (I&rsquo;ve been on the wrong end of a YouTube video takedown due to an anonymous complaint with no recourse to appeal&hellip;)</p>

<p>But as a gamasutra opinion article basically noted, the ESA an industry group, so what do you expect them to do? Nevertheless, the RIAA is ostensibly doing what it&rsquo;s supposed to do, and it generates plenty of criticism, while it seems to me the ESA has gotten largely a free pass (the <a href="http://igda.org/">IGDA</a> is the only game-industry organization I can think of that would counterbalance the ESA, and they&rsquo;re better about taking to task industry outsiders, like Amazon).</p>

<p>And the ESA is not above representing itself as the champion of the invidual gamer - they run the <a href="http://http://videogamevoters.org/">Video Game Voter&rsquo;s network</a> which enthusiastically encourages gamers to protect their free speech rights as it pertains to games.</p>

<p>You&rsquo;ll find nothing about SOPA on that site. At least the last line in the About page identifies the network as &ldquo;sponsored&rdquo; by the ESA. I don&rsquo;t recall seeing that the first time I visited the site, nor any such identification at their E3 booth - I took the free t-shirt, though!</p>
