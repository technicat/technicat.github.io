This update was a long time coming. I started working on it with the beta of Unity 3.2, and after releasing a couple of other apps with 3.2 (to make sure there weren’t any surprises), I found myself in the Unit 3.3 beta period. Of course, I could have released with a beta build, but I’d made so many big changes, and by now there were two Unity versions of changes, it took a few weeks to just wring out the bugs.

Overall, the new Unity versions brought improved performance, not least due to some new shaders which I used heavily. As a result, there’s more content in this version of [HyperBowl](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/hyperbowl/id344209253?mt=8), the like the ceiling-mounted structure in the selection lane.

The bump mapping shaders now work. Very cool!

And I started adding traffic to the San Francisco and Tokyo lanes, animating it with [iTween](http://itween.pixelplacement.com/). In fact, one time-consuming change was recoding nearly all the animation scripts with iTween.
