<p>I&rsquo;m not sure how we&rsquo;re supposed to have restored confidence in the economy when we basically still have the same people running the same institutions. I suppose I should feel confident that I&rsquo;m loaning them my tax money. In any case, I&rsquo;m not that worried - I&rsquo;m fortunate that I bought my property long ago enough that I still have decent equity (I have to say luck - if I was truly savvy, I would have sold during the bubble). And I&rsquo;m not terribly insecure about employment - if you&rsquo;re decent at your job in this business and you&rsquo;re not an utter pain to work with, you shouldn&rsquo;t have to whine about outsourcing and H1-B visas (if I ever do, I&rsquo;ll just complain about Canadians and Scandinavians, just to avoid the monotony of blaming Asians. Seriously, I&rsquo;ve worked with a lot of Canadians and Norwegians - they just hide among us more easily). If you&rsquo;re unfairly replaced, chances are it&rsquo;s by someone right out of college here in the USA, and that&rsquo;s nothing new - just look at the demographics in Silicon Valley, or your typical game company.</p>

<p>But back to confidence. When it comes to financial institutions, I&rsquo;d have to say my confidence is decreasing, based on my recent experiences with credit cards. A bank behind one of my company credit cards sent me a letter saying they were getting out of the credit card business, so stop using it. Another bank keeps asking me to apply for a company credit card that I already have. My personal bank persuaded me to sign up for online statements, stopped issuing online statements, and then charged me for a late payment fee. A few weeks ago I was ordering a book online and was asked if I wanted to save $15 bucks instantly by applying for an affiliated credit card. Well sure, but then the online application process informed me we&rsquo;ll get back to you, back to checkout with the full price of the book. When I asked the credit card company to cancel my application, since I only applied for the instant discount, the rep said sorry, once it&rsquo;s started, you can&rsquo;t cancel until you get the approval. A few days later, I received a letter saying they needed more income info from me - if I didn&rsquo;t supply it, they would take it as a cancellation request.</p>

<p>This is all in the last few months. The Keystone Kops are running our banks.</p>
