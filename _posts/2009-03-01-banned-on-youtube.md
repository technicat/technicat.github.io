I received this notification from YouTube that a video I posted violated their guidelines and was removed. Seems to me they could be a bit friendlier about it (why close with “sincerely” if the message just reads like a parking ticket?) - no way to appeal, and not even a mention of which guideline was violated. I’m guessing it was the CG nudity - the video was of a mocap demo using a sample provided by [ElektraShock.](http://www.elektrashock.com/)[![picture-8](http://itshardtofondlepenguins.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/picture-8.png "picture-8")](http://fugugames.com/unity.html)
