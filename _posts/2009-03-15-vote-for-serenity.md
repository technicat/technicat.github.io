Serenity is the by far the leading vote-getter in NASA’s [contest](http://www.nasa.gov/externalflash/name_ISS/index.html) to name the Node 3 addition to the Space Station, though Joss Whedon’s Firefly/Serenity fans may be concerned about write-in’s from Colbert Nation supporters.

This being NASA, I think they should take in account not only how cool the Serenity spaceship looks (especially on the Blue-Ray disc I just bought at the Circuit City meltdown), but also a highly-underpraised aspect of the Firefly/Serenity universe - it’s quiet in space! Almost all sci-fi shows from Star Trek to to Star Wars to Babylon 5 to Battlestar Galactica (old and new) feature a cacaphony of engine’s revving, lasers (sorry, phasers) blasting and guns blazing. 2001: A Space Odyssey showed it could be done quietly and scientifically correctly, and Joss Whedon did it again, without playing the Blue Danube.

But I feel obligated also to point out a highly-undercriticized aspect of Joss Whedon’s sci-fi vision - where are all the Chinese? I’m accustomed to the lack of Asian representation in Hollywood, but this is supposed to be world spawned from a great Anglo-Chinese alliance in which everyone swears in Chinese and knows how to use chopsticks. There are so few recognizably Asian characters in the series and movie, I was startled to see an Asian face in the bonus features on the Blue-Ray disc (I guess that was a bonus!).

Joss Whedon’s shows are among my favorite (still not sure about Dollhouse…), but they do have “written by a white Hollywood screenwriter” stamped all over them, much like Paul Haggis screenplays and half the shows on the WB. In contrast, take Battlestar Galactica - the fleet is visibly mixed-race and led by a Latino, and it’s no big deal. Even the Cylons have gender and racial variety (just don’t call them toasters!) Hmm, for the next Space Station addition, I hope they name it Galactica.
