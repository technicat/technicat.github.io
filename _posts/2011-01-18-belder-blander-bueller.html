<p>This caught my eye when I checked the <a href="http://forum.unity3d.com/">Unity forum</a> on my <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/app/unity-feed/id400855804?mt=8">Unity Feed</a> app recently. Two of the top three posts are about <a href="http://blender.org/">Blender</a>, but misspell it in the title (actually it appear to be the same post, edited and misspelled differently each time). It&rsquo;s not as bad as the one I saw today that misspelled &ldquo;help&rdquo; in the title (possibly the poster was distracted by also typing it in all caps and appending a row of exclamation  marks), but still, how about a little open source respect!</p>
