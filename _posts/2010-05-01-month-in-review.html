<p>Before I go to sleep, I try to recount my accomplishments for the day. Sort of a personal scrum meeting. Also, it helps avoid insomnia. I won&rsquo;t inflict that on you readers in the form of daily blogs (that&rsquo;s what Facebook statuses are for), but it&rsquo;s been a busy month, so I&rsquo;ll list the highlights:
</p><ul><li>Got an iPad. I considered waiting until my birthday (that&rsquo;s how I rationalized getting my first MacBook Pro), but I felt I should get a move on in updating my iPhone apps. Besides, they were in stock at the Apple Store.</li>
	<li>Updated <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/hyperbowl/id344209253?mt=8">HyperBowl</a> for the iPad. Not too bad - it took a couple of days, got rejected because now it needs to support multiple orientations (at least upside-down), resubmitted, and got accepted.</li>
	<li>Filed my taxes. I actually start in December, filling it in and itemizing deductions over the months until I can&rsquo;t stand it anymore. I always leave some money on the table in return for keeping some last bit of sanity. It&rsquo;s a fair trade, I think.</li>
	<li>Celebrated my birthday by spending a couple of days in San Clemente to relax. Instead of visiting the beach, I raided the local used book store, <a href="http://www.mathomhousebooks.com/">Mathom House Books</a>. Picked up a dozen sci-fi novels.</li>
	<li>Updated the individual <a href="http://hyperbowl3d.com/">HyperBowl</a> lane apps for the iPad.</li>
	<li>Dropped by the doc for a periodic blood test. Whereupon they called me up and said they got the results and I needed to come in immediately. Whereupon they said, never mind, sorry about that.</li>
	<li>Watched the season DVD set of Breaking Bad.</li>
	<li>Watched the season 2 Blue-Ray set of Sarah Connor Chronicles.</li>
	<li>Updated <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/fugubowl/id297032758?mt=8">Fugu Bowl</a> for the iPad.</li>
	<li>Brought my car in for an oil change. Good news is I only drove a thousand miles since my last oil change five months ago. Bad news is I still ended up spending three hundred dollars.</li>
	<li>Caught up on Flash Forward on the iPad using the ABC Player.</li>
	<li>Caught up on Lost on the iPad using the ABC Player.</li>
	<li>Did some major work on <a href="http://bluemars.com/">Blue Mars</a>. You&rsquo;ll see it in the next beta release.</li>
</ul>
Now I need to get going on the next set of iPad releases. But first, I&rsquo;m going to start catching up on Caprica episodes&hellip;
