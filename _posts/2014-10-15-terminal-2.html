<p>SFO has been my favorite US airport because of the international terminal with its food courts (dim sum!), the art exhibits, and the SFMOMA store. But I went through Terminal 2 for the first time, and that&rsquo;s actually a bit nicer, maybe because that&rsquo;s where Virgin America connects. More good eats (even a Pinkberry!), a good bookstore, really nice chairs (the cocoon kind) and laptop tables, and some nice art:</p>
