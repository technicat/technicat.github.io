<p>It&rsquo;d be an exaggeration to say I&rsquo;m a fan of <a href="http://www.kathygriffin.net/">Kathy Griffin</a> - I haven&rsquo;t exactly followed her career and I hated that Suddenly Susan show. But I do find her amusing, especially when she gets in trouble (really, did anyone actually believe Dakota Fanning was in rehab?), and I like that she dated the <a href="http://www.woz.org/">Woz</a>. His appearance on her reality show about her life on the &ldquo;D-list&rdquo; was hilarious - the episode in which Team Griffin got pissed off when the anti-money Woz insisted on giving away t-shirts for free.</p>

<p>The Woz connection obligated me to buy her recent <a href="http://www.kathygriffin.net/">book</a>, especially since it included a chapter of Woz-Griffin emails (and was 25% off at Ralph&rsquo;s). As a bonus, I found the book breezily entertaining with lot of takes on celebrities, as you might expect. As a double-bonus, Griffin goes into surprising depth about unflattering and uncomfortable aspects of her life, like her body issues (resulting in binge eating and cosmetic surgery that nearly killed her) and a rather dangerous and self-destructive family member. As a triple-bonus, you take away from this book an appreciation of how tough it is to be in show-business, even just to get on the &ldquo;D-list&rdquo;. OK, I guess I&rsquo;m a fan.</p>
