<p>Facebook deservedly has taken a lot of heat for its attitude toward privacy, but Yahoo is arguably worse. I created a Yahoo account and discovered there are only two options for all my information - available to connections and available to everyone. Not available is not an option. And with maximum privacy settings, my public profile shows my gender and age (even though my birthday is set to connections-only). No blind auditions here!</p>
