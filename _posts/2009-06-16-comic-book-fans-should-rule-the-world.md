I received a nice letter from the [Comic Book Legal Defense Fund](http://cbldf.org/) thanking me for my membership and relating cases of interest to their mission. That’s a typical courtesy of charities but what struck me as unusual was what wasn’t in the letter - an appeal for more money. Every other thank-you letter I’ve received from a charity has been a thank-you-may-I-have-another letter, which reminds me of the heroin addicts who used to accost me in Baltimore (“Can you spare a dollar? Thanks. Can you spare five?”), or maybe of startup companies. In any case, contrary to the stereotype of comic book fans as socially inept, here’s a case where they seem further up on their Ms. Manners than “professionals”.

Another example is [Comic Con](http://comic-con.org/). The show is run by a non-profit organization staffed by volunteers, and it is the best-run, best-value and most fun event I’ve attended (compared to E3, GDC, Siggraph, Tokyo Game Show…)

I’d feel a lot better if I knew there were some comic book fans in the Obama administration.
