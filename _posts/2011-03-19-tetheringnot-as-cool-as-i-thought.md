My enthusiasm over the mobile hotspot feature on my Samsung Vibrant phone has diminished, after I received a text message from T-Mobile today saying “Due to your high data usage this billing cycle, your data speed will be reduced for the remainder of this billing cycle.” So much for my “unlimited data plan”. I guess I shouldn’t have tried downloading XCode with it.
