One of my Comic Con traditions is Ric Meyer’s Kung Fu film festival. It has a more extravagant name and isn’t just Kung Fu, but it is all action. The first one I attended clued me in to the The Raid: Redemption, considered by some to be the best martial arts film of all time.

This time, for those of us who haven’t seen the sequel, he showed clips from Raid 2. also considered by some to be the best martial arts movie of all time. Holy moly, it’s violent. It’s awesome. Here’s the official trailer.
