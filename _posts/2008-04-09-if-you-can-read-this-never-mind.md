I’ve seen enough months of work, and even entire projects, lost due to sloppy IT risk managment, that I’ve been evolving an essay on [IT Practices](http://www.technicat.com/writing/it.html).

But in the past few months I’ve experienced the worst ISP outages I’ve ever seen, and if this web site seems slow or times out, well, yes. But credit Dreamhost for being candid about it in [Another Anatomy](http://blog.dreamhost.com/2008/04/07/another-anatomy/)

Apparently, honesty, or at least humor, pays - they’ve won the Best Corporate Blog in the [Blogger’s Choice Awards](http://www.bloggerschoiceawards.com/)

But the price you pay for trying out new hardware on the only cluster that is open to new customers, and trying to perform live maintenance, OS upgrades, and data migration without actually figuring out the original problem while signing up new customers and allowing existing customers to continue adding new data, is a steady stream of tirades from the angry (and uncivilized) masses on the [server status blog](http://www.dreamhoststatus.com/)
