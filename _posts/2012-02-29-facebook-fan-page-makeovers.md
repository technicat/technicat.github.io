I have a confession to make - I actually like marketing. It’s more fun than filing bug reports, foraging through pages of documentation and months of forum postings, and wondering “why isn’t this working?” Which is why I killed some time today prematurely adopting the new Facebook fan page format for my [HyperBowl](http://facebook.com/hyperbowl), [Fugu Games](http://facebook.com/fugugames) and [Technicat](http://facebook.com/technicatllc) pages. It’s really just catching up with the personal Facebook pages as far using the Timeline layout, which is a mixed bag, but it does have some cosmetic and functional improvements. The cover image adds a little pizzazz, and there is a Featured Like option in the Edit settings that allows you to ensure certain page favorites are always displayed first. This allows me to add page favorites willy nilly (they’re mostly pages of friends and all around good people) and still make my other Facebook pages most visible.
