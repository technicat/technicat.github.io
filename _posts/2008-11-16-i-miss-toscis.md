The New York Times article on Boston “[A Science Lover’s Kind of Town](http://travel.nytimes.com/2008/11/14/travel/escapes/14american.html)” brought back some memories of my favorite Cambridge haunts, including [Toscanini’s](http://www.tosci.com/), the [MIT Press Bookstore](http://web.mit.edu/bookstore/www/), [The MIT Coop](http://store.thecoop.com/coopstore/estore_mit_home.jsp), and [Mary Chung](http://www.mit.edu/people/eichin/marys/marysmenu.html).

The article devotes a lot more space to the area museums, but I have to admit I only recall going to the [MIT Museum](http://web.mit.edu/museum/) and [Boston Science Museum](http://www.mos.org/) once, and the [Harvard Museum of Natural History](http://www.hmnh.harvard.edu/) only recently.

Huntington Beach is far from Cambridge (in many ways), but it’s getting there. We have Mexican ice cream here, and the [Znow’s](http://www.yelp.com/biz/znows-ice-cream-huntington-beach) in my neighborhood is particularly good. (They have the advantage of of year-long warm weather - it’s still in the high eighties this week). The local Barnes and Nobles doesn’t have a lot of MIT Press books, but it compares favorably to The Coop and the other tech bookstore I used to frequent in [Kendall Square](http://www.kendallsquare.org/), [Quantum Books](http://www.quantumbooks.com/). Now, if I could just find a [Legal’s Seafood](http://legalsseafood.com/)…
