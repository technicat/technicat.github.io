<p>At some point a few years ago I finally realized that I&rsquo;d wasted waaay to much time responding to recruiter emails, so I disabled the email address listed on my online resume. I figured that will at least winnow out the ones not sharp enough to click on the &ldquo;Contact&rdquo; link on my web site. That worked pretty well - I didn&rsquo;t hear from any recruiters at all.</p>

<p>But recruiters love social networking tools. (And Microsoft Word - &ldquo;please send your resume in word format&rdquo; &ldquo;can you reformat your resume in Word?&rdquo; and &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how to cut-and-paste or I&rsquo;m too lazy to do any semblance of work for my commission&rdquo; - OK, I made up that last one). Recruiters used to invite me to join their LinkedIn network after wasting my time (one reason I&rsquo;ve resisted joining LinkedIn), so I guess I shouldn&rsquo;t be surprised that now I&rsquo;m get messages from recruiters on Facebook. Oddly, they still say they can&rsquo;t find another way to reach me. But it doesn&rsquo;t look like I&rsquo;ve missed anything - the message is typically some vague description of a job, usually asking me to do their job for them by referring anyone I know, and there&rsquo;s at best a fifty-fifty chance of getting an acknowledgment if I bother replying that I&rsquo;m not looking. I was thinking that Facebook might get ruined by scalability issues, buggy programming or obnoxious apps, but there&rsquo;s a new threat in town. Recruiters.</p>
