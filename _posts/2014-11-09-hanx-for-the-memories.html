<p>I can&rsquo;t say I really miss using typewriters - I tended to type fast, clumping up the keys, and used a lot of whiteout fixing the corresponding keys (so you could say my typing style was destined for computer keyboards), and I never got around to writing a famous novel on one. But I did use a typewriter as my first printer, transcribing my Apple II BASIC listings from screen to paper.</p>

<p>And typewriter action is just cool. I always thought a typewriter app would be cool (but notice how I didn&rsquo;t go around saying &ldquo;I have a great idea for an app if someone would just to the programming&hellip;&rdquo;), and indeed from no other than Tom Hanks (or his wallet), comes this this typewriter app, called Hanx. See, if you really do have a good app idea, someone will make it!</p>
