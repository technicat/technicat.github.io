<p>OK, this is a loose analogy - a more obvious statement would be to say Apple is the new Sony, given Apple&rsquo;s dominant position as the provider of cool media players, fashionable laptops, and aesthetics for the &ldquo;creative class&rdquo;. But I started thinking of Apple as the new SGI when I bought my first MacOSX machine, a Mac Mini. Both the hardware and fancy-schmancy Unix desktop reminded me of how cool the SGI Indie and Irix were, respectively (and expensive).</p>

<p>And then there&rsquo;s the hubris. I thought SGI had great hardware, software and engineers, but customer service didn&rsquo;t just suck, it was arrogant. For the privilege of spending a thousand or two to enroll in their developer support program (which you couldn&rsquo;t even report bugs too, you had to call those in over the phone to a separate paid support program - try reading a stacktrace over the phone!), you had to fill out a form describing your product development plans and when you were going to release it within the next year. The program contact ignored my points that we didn&rsquo;t like to discuss our plans with vendors of competing products (like SGI&rsquo;s Maya) and that significant products usually took longer than a year to develop, and then rubbed salt in the wound with a final &ldquo;this would have been easier if you&rsquo;d just filled out the form in the first place.</p>

<p>Apple isn&rsquo;t quite that bad - certainly the customer service is far superior and more courteous (the Apple Store is my favorite computer store, although Fry&rsquo;s and Best Buy set the bar low). But there are glimpses. I remember a long, long time when Next was the next big thing, I sent them a resume and received a postcard in response, informing me that they didn&rsquo;t accept unsolicited resumes. In other words, don&rsquo;t call use, we&rsquo;ll call you. Really, it would have been more polite to just throw my resume away. Now, that was Next, but Next was Job&rsquo;s new Apple, and Next is now in Apple (and in MacOSX). At my first WWDC, I waited at the registration desk while the staffers huddle in a meeting. One of them spotted me, wandered over to me, said simply, &quot;we&rsquo;re in a meeting&rdquo;, then wandered back. He reminded me of the girl at the recycling center here who would sit there, munching on her baloney sandwich, and inform me dourly &ldquo;I&rsquo;m on my break&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Those are minor slights, but where it gets worrying is in App Store (and now Mac App Store) approvals. All in all, it&rsquo;s a lot easier to self-publish on Apple platforms than on a console - it&rsquo;s not even close. But consoles do include a concept pre-approval in their process. In contrast, you could spend months working on an app that Apple won&rsquo;t approve (ask Adobe and Google). Although there is now a published list of Apple approval guidelines that is supposed to eliminate the suspense, it&rsquo;s vagueness, content and tone still boil down to, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll approve it if we think it&rsquo;s good enough for us&rdquo;.</p>

<p>And shades of SGI, I think I detect a push to tie developers onto Apple-specific code. There was the brouhaha over the earlier developer terms that seemed intended to block out Adobe but also technically ruled out a lot of middleware (including Unity). That&rsquo;s apparently over, but my last two AppMakr-based apps were rejected, based on two completely different rules in the guidelines, and in both cases the suggested remedy was to add more native iOS features. When I was working on both SGI and Windows versions of a product, SGI sent us three, count-em three, marketers and one tech person to persuade us to tie our product to SGI-proprietary libraries. If anything, it had the opposite effect. I surmise that Apple is adopting the same tactic in the face of rising Android popularity. But as the saying goes, if you love them, let them go. Or approve their apps.</p>
