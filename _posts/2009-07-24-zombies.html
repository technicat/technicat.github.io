<p>Zombies seem to be all the rage these days, and that includes the App Store. The first iPhone game I really enjoyed is called, well, Zombie. The controls are as simple as you can get - just tap on the screen in the direction you want to shoot. It&rsquo;s the iPhone equivalent of button mashing (screen mashing?)</p>

<p>The best-selling Unity-based iPhone game apparently is Zombieville. I cheaped out and tried Zombieville Lite:</p>

<p>Somewhat more involved controls (enough so that you do have to read the help), but still pretty simple, and overall simple gameplay, plus nice art and sound. Brainless (get it?) fun!</p>
