<p>Since I only have six working TV channels, one of which is the Huntington Beach city channel (HBTV), I&rsquo;ve been catching snippets of 100 Years of Huntington Beach, basically a pleasant trip down memory lane including reminiscences of the city&rsquo;s first beach concession, the introduction of surfing, yada yada. But I was appalled by the segment mentioning the internment of local Japanese-Americans (including citizens and whole families) during World War II. It came off as, the General had a tough decision to make, and he made it. Followed by a resident remembering a nice boy she wanted to date before he got sent off to the camp. Oh, well. Sucks to be them.

So I sent a semi-snippy suggestion to the city that they edit the film to remove that segment, if they couldn&rsquo;t do the topic justice, and received this prompt, polite and not altogether satisfactory reply:
</p><blockquote>Thank you for your thoughtful comments regarding the history video. I know we tried to include it as part of the history of Huntington Beach. I will share your concerns with others in leadership in the community. The program is featured on our government channel, website and was shown on KOCE. We have also distributed hundreds of copies to individuals, middle schools and high schools. Yours is the first &ldquo;negative&rdquo; comment we have received and I can assure you people of all different backgrounds have viewed the video. Thanks again for your input.</blockquote>
No-one-else-complained-about-it is the type of reply I used to get from apartment landlords, and it&rsquo;s pretty weak as an academic argument. We-already-distributed-it-to-a-bunch-of-students is just upsetting. I don&rsquo;t remember getting any of this subject when I was in school - I hope there isn&rsquo;t a whole generation of kids who are learning that sending American citizens to live behind barbed wire because of their race was a &ldquo;difficult choice&rdquo;. And aside from portraying it as a debatable decision (I thought we were beyond that, like the debatability of separate-but-equal and anti-miscegenation laws), the segment was light on facts, not mentioning that the governer and President supported it, that it only took place in California and not even Hawaii where Pearl Harbor happened, and that many had their land usurped by unscrupulous neighbors.

Finally, I can&rsquo;t believe all the &ldquo;different backgrounds&rdquo; included anyone who&rsquo;s family was affected by this, or, say, Arab/Muslim/Persian Americans who might consider this type of thing could happen to them. (If there&rsquo;s ever a war with China, I guess I better get packing). The HB centennial program includes a couple of talks on the internment, one from the last baby born inside the camp, so surely some people in the city government know better.

Whoever&rsquo;s in charge of that film could take a cue from Ken Burns, who adjusted his documentary <a href="http://www.pbs.org/thewar/">The War</a> after complaints that he failed to depict Latino-Americans. He said afterward that the film was just as good after the change (although in some odd logic he said that validated his original methods - c'mon, you&rsquo;re a media guy, just admit you&rsquo;re a product of culture just like everyone else. I grew up with 70&rsquo;s television, and the only minorities I remember from then is Speedy Gonzales, Pat Morita speaking fake Chinese in Happy Days, various African-Americans on the wrong side of the law in cop movies, and Bill Cosby. And in this supposedly post-racial time, the situation isn&rsquo;t a lot better - TV land is by default white).

The War also has extensive treatment of the internment and the Japanese-Americans who volunteered anyway to fight in Europe and suffered terrible losses there. If Ken Burns isn&rsquo;t your cup of tea, you can listen to George Takei talk about it on this <a href="http://www.asianamericanmedia.org/jainternment/">web site</a>, or just google &ldquo;Japanese internment&rdquo; - there&rsquo;s plenty of information.
