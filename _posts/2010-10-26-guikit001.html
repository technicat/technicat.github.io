<p>I&rsquo;m beginning to think that Unity middleware is a good business. (or since Unity is already middleware, this would be middle-middleware?) So far I&rsquo;ve purchased the <a href="http://stinkbot.com/">iPhone Enhancement Pack</a> for iOS 3.x, and for iOS 4.x I&rsquo;ve already bought three of the plugins offered by <a href="http://prime31.com/">Prime31</a>. Now I&rsquo;m looking at <a href="http://gameassets.net/">GUIKit001</a> - it&rsquo;s a bit more than I want to pay right now, and I&rsquo;m not sure it&rsquo;s a match for what I need (HyperBowl already has its own level selection system, for example), but it does look good and addresses one issue I have with the UnityGUI system, which is that it doesn&rsquo;t automatically handle different screen resolutions. And I do have one App Store review complaining that I don&rsquo;t have a Settings menu (nothing about what exactly they want in it), so&hellip;maybe&hellip;</p>
