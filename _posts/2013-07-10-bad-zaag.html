<p>Apparently the iPad 3 is just too thick and heavy. I liked my Zaag keyboard a lot, but my iPad 3 kept toppling out of the slot and crashing onto my table with a nerve-jangling impact (padded iPad, anyone?). So I upgraded to the latest Zaag which works around the problem by building a case around the keyboard that keeps the iPad propped up. It does make for a better case but trades off convenience having the iPad just sitting atop the keyboard unencumbered. The big problem, however, is that the new keyboard is prone to losing its keys when I drop it. After two drops, I&rsquo;m relying heavily on my touch typing training.</p>
