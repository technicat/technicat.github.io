<p>I&rsquo;ve been using Mogl for a few weeks now, and really, just the cashback feature seems to make it worthwhile. The number of participating restaurants in my area was small, but seems to be growing. I also really like the meal donation aspect.</p>

<p>However, I turned off email notifications because I didn&rsquo;t really care about how I just lost the number one spot at a nearby restaurant. It actually matters, since there is a cash reward, but still, don&rsquo;t want to hear it. And I was exasperated to find Mogl posts on my Facebook wall for each of my dining events, so I turned that off, too (it didn&rsquo;t help that each post started off with &ldquo;Boom!&rdquo;).</p>

<p>So here&rsquo;s an example where &ldquo;gamification&rdquo; and social networking detracts from the appealing features - good old-fashioned cashback and donations.</p>
