Last week I read James Wagner Au’s _The Making of Second Life_. I found it entertaining in a _Wired_ magazine style, but as an “embedded reporter”, the author spent more time describing the odd goings-on in [Second Life](http://www.secondlife.com/) (vividly depicting how virtual sex is consummated, yet claiming that the media has overhyped it) and the cuteness of the Second Life staffers (their descriptions typically include “brunette” or “redhead”) than on the competitive aspects of the business. In particular, [There](http://www.there.com/) is mentioned as the primary, and second-place, competitor, but is only mentioned in a handful of lines scattered among three separate pages.

Now, I think an interesting questions is, how did Second Life come out on top, and why not There?<!--more--> Everyone has heard of Second Life, but I’ve even met some people working on massively multiplayer virtual worlds who hadn’t heard of There. For a while, There had the contract to run the online Laguna Beach for MTV, but eventually that was turned over to Second Life.

I bring this up partly out of pettiness - I interviewed with There back in 2003, and got really annoyed with them after their third quiz (or fourth, depending how you count them) and terminated the interview (guess I won’t be interviewing with Google!). But I think that may be indicative of one of their defects - I recall at the time of the interview they seemed awfully unfocused, giving the traditional logic-puzzle I-just-want-to-know-how-you-think programmer quizzes instead of delving into my computer graphics and game development experience, which you’d think would be relevant. And their numbers struck me - at the time they boasted $27 million in funding, much of it founders money, but reading between the lines, that sounds like they burned through a lot of cash before getting to beta (Au’s book lists the year 1998 next to the company name, which is misleading - the actual beta launch was in 2003), and they had to dip into their own pockets to do it.

So, they took longer than Linden Labs to get their product out, probably spent more money (Au’s book indicates Linden Labs ran pretty lean), possibly were less focussed (hard to say), definitely had a more awkward name (try using There a lot in conversation). But one thing stood out when they explained their concept to me in the interview - they envisioned making money by selling branded virtual items to avatars, e.g. virtual Levi jeans. Maybe it’s just me, but, why would anyone want that? People join fantasy worlds to become fantasy people and acquire fantasy items, or at least not items you can get at a shopping outlet in Barstow.

It seems to me this is a case of tech vision vs. the revenue model (I was gonna call it the “MBA revenue model” but I’d risk offending a lot of b-school grads I know, and yes, I don’t know really know what goes on in those classes). Second Life, as far as I can tell, started with a general, idealistic, and vague, vision of an online world with the Field of Dreams variation “they will come, and they will build it”, and eventually stumbled into their current revenue model of currency exchange and real estate. There, as it was described to me, sounded like a bunch of retailers trying to get in on all that Everquest money. The latter is fine if you’re working with a proven revenue model, i.e. if you’re selling something you know people want. But mentally ringing the cash register for something mundane just because you’ve wrapped it in the latest-hyped tech package (in this case online virtual worlds) is just wishful thinking.

My last company in the Bay Area stumbled into a vision (deploying a consumer portal and browser for wireless mobile platforms) and then stumbled right out (following the VC money, they switched to the corporate market - they get another round of funding, but not much happened after that). When I looked around for something else interesting, there wasn’t any. I talked with an Andreesen-backed venture that was going to track online ads (there was probably a decent vision - the marketing guy was really excited - but I didn’t get it, and I wasn’t sure the lead tech guy got it, either), a group of web developers who didn’t have an interesting web site but were acquired by E-Trade because they were a group of web developers, and three MBA classmates who were starting up a company because all their friends were doing it, and their idea was putting a barcode scanner on a phone so you could immediately buy online as soon as you saw something on the rack. Again, maybe it’s just me, but why?

The end of this story: I moved to LA to join a startup putting snarky 3D animated characters on customer support web sites. Interesting vision, questionable application (if you’re going to a web site to troubleshoot or complain, do you really want an avatar giving you attitude and misunderstanding half of what you say? I had enough of that with the old AT&T operators). I could have looked like a genius for getting out of Dodge before the dot-com bust, except my new employers were attempting to beat the Turing Test and didn’t even have the skills to put together a run-of-the-mill e-commerce site. A case where tech vision is tech delusion. Don’t join a tech startup run by Hollywood producers! (Yahoo, take note)
