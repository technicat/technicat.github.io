<p>This is my first official week at WordsEye, my first salaried job in twelve years! I say more about it when we launch, but feel free to check it out and preregister at <a href="http://wordseye.com/.">http://wordseye.com/.</a> In the mantime, here&rsquo;s the first image I made with the first incarnation of WordsEye several years ago.</p>
