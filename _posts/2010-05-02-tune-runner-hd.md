After filling up my iPad with free apps, I finally loosened the purse strings a bit and bought Tune Runner HD. I already knew it’s a pretty cool game since I have the free iPhone version, and besides, those guys at [Appy](http://appyentertainment.com/) paid my mortgage when I worked for them at High Moon Studios on Darkwatch.

Tune Runner is my favorite App product so far and a great example of a game obviously designed for the iPhone or iPad. Levels are generated from tunes that you buy or select from your own iPhone/iPad library. As the tune plays, you draw the shapes as they appear on the screen. And it’s pretty.

I’ve started taking a page from their book and started integrating photo and song selectors into my [Fugu Games](http://fugugames.com/) using the Unity iPhone Enhancement Pack, though more as an afterthought. Shortly after I added a photo picker to Fugu Maze so you can set your own maze wall texture, sales increased ten-fold for a couple of weeks (and alas, dropped down again). With the vagaries of the App Store market, it’s hard to tell if the new feature was responsible for the spike, but if it is, the Enhancement Pack has paid for itself. But I haven’t tried it out on the iPad, yet, and I’m waiting for at least one bug fix - the perils of juggling multiple middleware…
