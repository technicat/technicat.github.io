I hadn’t planned to spend much time watching the [Olympics](http://www.nbcolympics.com/), but it’s addictive, and hard to avoid when it’s broadcasting on three channels at a time. At one point I switched to CNN only to hear [Rick Sanchez](http://edition.cnn.com/CNN/anchors_reporters/sanchez.rick.html), reporting on the bloody conflict over [South Ossetia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_in_South_Ossetia_(2008)), explaining “Why do we care? Oil.” Then I switched back.

I could do without the [medal counting](http://results.beijing2008.cn/WRM/ENG/INF/GL/95A/GL0000000.shtml) - I like watching some of the more unusual sports (blowing up clay pigeons with shotguns - what’s not to like?). I found fencing both disturbing and fascinating - lightning quick action by figures in what looks like bee-keeping outfits, triggering green and red lights that seem to have no correlation to who actually won the round, and an exultant or frustrated scream by each competitor, I can’t tell which. My favorite is the boxing competition. Besides the action and commentary by [Teddy Atlas](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teddy_Atlas), I love the sportsmanship shown by the fighters after each match, encouraging each other after victory/defeat and shaking hands with the opposing corner.

For a great Olympic read, see[ Rome 1960: The Olympics that Changed the World.  
](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2219561.Rome_1960_The_Olympics_That_Changed_the_World) Amid the backdrop of the Cold War and racial oppression in the United States, and many firsts like television coverage and a doping scandal, it’s the stories of the individual competitors that stand out, and the camaradie among them, in some cases transcending national boundaries, like the deep friendship and rivalry between [Rafer Johnson](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafer_Johnson) and [C.K. Yang](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yang_Chuan-Kwang)

The author,[David Maraniss](http://www.davidmaraniss.com/), describes some highlights of the [1960 Olympics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1960_Summer_Olympics) in a briefer[Newsweek article.](http://www.newsweek.com/id/148999)
