Last year as a cost-cutting move I declined to renew my registration for wholebraingames.com. It’s one of those domain names that I registered on a whim and thought maybe I’ll have a use for it one day, but one of my rules for keeping a domain name is that I can type it easily, and for some reason I kept typing wholebriangames.com. (Another rule is that people can spell it, which disqualifies digitalchameleon.com, a name which I was fond of but I sure was tired of having to spell out “chameleon” for people)

The inspiration for wholebraingames.com was my irritation every time I heard someone talk about that left brain right brain crap. First of all, it’s wrong (even though I’ve seen a Harvard Business Review article presuming its validity). Just because a phrase has the word “brain” in it doesn’t mean there’s actually any science behind it (same with it being uttered in pop psychology).

Second, it obviously leads to demeaning stereotypes. Oh, look at those quantitative geeks without a creative bone in their bodies (I like the Big Bang Theory, but I gotta admit that’s the cast right there) and those artsy airheads who can’t balance a checkbook. Never mind that top scientific minds tend to be creative and also artistically talented, or at the very least aesthetically appreciative. And anyone can be trained in both (hey, every Asian American who’s had to go through the straight-A/music-lesson childhood knows that). But seriously, have you ever looked at someone who can’t form a logical thought and concluded, what an idiot, but he must be really artistic, or someone who has no taste and concluded, wow he must be a rocket scientist? I hope not.

Third, it’s self-limiting. If you tell people, hey, I’m left-brained or right-brained, you might be pumping up your self-image as a creative visionary or brilliant coder/mathematician/scientist, but you’re also putting out a lame excuse for other deficiencies (plus, if you’re a brilliant scientist, you should know the science is bad).

As far as I know, wholebraingames.com is still available, so it’s all yours. And if you’re making games, use your whole brain.
