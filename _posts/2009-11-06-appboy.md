I tried out [AppBoy](http://appboy.com/) this week. I can’t say it’s driven any appreciable sales, but it is one of the nicer looking iPhone app sites, and it’s got a few twists that push the social networking angle - a [personal page](http://appboy.com/technicat) that displays your own “store”, favorites list, and blog/site/twitter/facebook links.
