I did a search on the App Store for maze games, recently, and got lots and lots of results. But I’m really just interested in 3D mazes, for comparison to my own app. I’m sure this is not a complete set, but here’s a roundup of the ones I know about.

This is the first one I found and installed last year. It’s called, appropriately, Maze3D. With it’s wireframe rendering, it reminds me of an old Apple II game (Wizardry?) that made a huge impression on me on the possibilities of 3D computer graphics. It’s free, so nothing to complain about.

The next three apps use the Unity engine and thus feature richer graphics (although still constrained by the iPhone hardware limitations). FuguMaze is my entry into this niche. It’s a port of my Mac widget and is really more an attempt to produce an atmospheric experience than any kind of competitive or scoring game, which is why I’ve avoided adding timers or objectives like the other mazes (despite numerous comments on the App Store reviews - I’m sticking to my guns. For now).

FuguMaze was, to my surprise, my most popular widget, and same goes for the app, which received 20,000 downloads in its first week. So I started charging $.99 for it and the downloads went way down. But that’s another story.

Labyrinth 3D was the next Unity maze to show up and featured flying navigation, using the tilt control, rather than a first-person character view. Also priced at $.99 if I recall.

RealMaze 3D is a really 3D maze, i.e. you can move among levels via ladders. It addresses some issues I had with FuguMaze: better performance by minimizing triangles per wall (I’ve avoided doing that because I don’t want to lose the spotlights) and a nice tutorial. Fortunately for me, this app is priced just a bit higher, $1.99.

And finally, MazeShifter is the most recent Unity-based maze, featuring an objective (I think it involves finding an object) and a map. Also in one of the lower pricing tiers, either $.99 or $1.99.
