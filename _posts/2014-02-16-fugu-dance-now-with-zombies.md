I saw the Cartoon Zombies pack on the Unity Asset Store on sale, recently, and I saw it has a dancing animation (Thriller-style), so figured why not, my [Fugu Dance](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.technicat.fugudance) app could use a refresher. So now itâ€™s got skeletons and zombies (boy and girl). Shake to switch among dancers. A short while ago I added the Nebula 2 skybox pack and reflective water, so overall it looks cooler, too.
