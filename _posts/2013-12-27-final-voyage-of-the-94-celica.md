Today, my â€˜94 Celica starts a new life as a San Francisco city car transporting its new owner to work at a wine shop. But I managed to get in one last California road trip - highlights included Pismo Beach and In 'n Out Burger.

I bought this car shortly after I moved to California at the end of 1995. Since then, the car has outlasted two cats, five Macintoshes, just as many iOS devices, and at least that many PCs. The car has delivered me to seven jobs and seven contract gigs, and four trips to Comic Con. Good times!
