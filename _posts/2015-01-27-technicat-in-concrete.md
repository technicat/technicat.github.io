My [technicat](http://technicat.com/) site, like this blog, has moved to a new web host and also to a new CMS. Originally, it was on Apache Forrest for a long time, then Drupal for eight years. This time I tried Concrete5, which appears to be oriented to designers (I think a designer colleague recommended it to me), and it does look better, I think, but I had some trouble figuring out how to configure the layout. So I went ultra simple. And I call it design.
