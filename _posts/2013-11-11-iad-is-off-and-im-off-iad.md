I’ve been sticking with iAd for the same reason I use AdMob as my sole ad provider for Android - it’s just easier. But my iAd revenue has been missing in action for the past week, and I finally found out why:[![Screen Shot 2013-11-12 at 12.45.27 AM](http://itshardtofondlepenguins.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Screen-Shot-2013-11-12-at-12.45.27-AM.png)](http://itshardtofondlepenguins.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Screen-Shot-2013-11-12-at-12.45.27-AM.png)Clicking on the red dots informed me my iAd contact had expired, but iTunesConnect shows the contract as current. So first, I tried to report the problem using the Contact Us link on iTunesConnect, but like a voice mail system, that only provides canned responses after making you select from a series of pulldown menus. So then I called developer support, to whom I gave my name and ID, stated the problem, and the nice person informed me my membership expired in 2014. Whereupon I informed her it’s still 2013. She then confirmed that I am indeed still an Apple developer and my iAd contract is current. Then she transferred me to the iAd department, where a nice gentlemen went through the entire process again, starting again with my name and ID, confirming the contract is still valid, and finally saying he would send an email requesting more information, which was this:

> Hi Philip, Thank you for taking the time to speak with me today regarding your iAd Network issue. As we discussed earlier, I understand you’re reporting an issue with the expiration date of your iAd contract. To better assist you, we need more information. Please provide the following: - Steps to reproduce the issue - Screenshots illustrating the issue - Web browser and version After we receive the requested information, we will investigate further and let you know when we have an update. Thank you for your assistance. Best Regards,

Now, didn’t I already report the reproduction steps twice? (In fact, when he asked if I’d ever contacted developer support before, I said, yeah, ten minutes ago). And really, screenshots - didn’t you just log into iTunesConnect and confirm the issue just now? And what does the web browser and version have to do anything? Do you suspect I’m really making iAd money and this is just a wacky Safari error? (Should I switch to IE?) And you know what? This [has happened before](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10899830/iad-contract-expired-not-so-says-itunesconnect-iad-module-thinks-otherwise)! (and didn’t they say in Battlestar Galactica that what happened before will happen again?) I just wish I hadn’t just bought some Apple stock. This was the kind of thing that happened with SGI before they went downhill (although they not only required you to phone in problems, they charged for it). So I’m thinking about just ignoring the email. The irony is that I would have preferred to email the report in the first place, but now I just feel I shouldn’t have to. And maybe it’s about time I try out some other ad networks.
