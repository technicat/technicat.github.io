I was perusing [Neil Gaiman](http://www.neilgaiman.com/)â€™s blog last week and saw mention of the [BBC](http://bbc.co.uk/) ordering the operator of the web site [Mazzmatazz](http://mazzmatazz.co.uk/) to take down postings of original [Doctor Who](http://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/) knitting patterns she created depicting the characters Ood and Adipose (according to [this article](http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article3949935.ece), the Doctor Who producers were more enthusiastic about the patterns). After some public outcry, the BBC has backed off a bit and decided to adopt the patterns as official BBC products.
