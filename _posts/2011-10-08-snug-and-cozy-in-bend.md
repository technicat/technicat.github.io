_Originally written on Epinions in September 2007:_

During winter in Bend, what you want in a hotel is a place to relax and warm up after a few hours of skiing or shopping. The Ameritel Inn fits the bill nicely.

The tall, spacious lobby is warmed by two large fireplaces surrounded by comfy sofas and armchairs. The rooms are not as elegant but long. The room I saw with one king bed looked like it could fit two easily, while the the room with two double beds appeared it could fit four double beds. And the upper floor rooms have nice plantation-style doors opening onto balconies with deck chairs and tables, overlooking the adjacent to the shops and theater of the Old Mill shopping center.

One portion of the extended lobby area is used for the complimentary breakfast, which to my delight consisted not merely of the typical pile of danishes but sausage, bacon, scrambled eggs, and coolest of all, a fancy swiveling waffle maker surrounded by cups of premixed batter for a little do-it-yourself waffle-making.

Another pleasant surprise was the complimentary wireless internet access - not so much the fact that it was free as the fact that it was so fast, easily six times the download rate at my local Starbucks. So I spent my Christmas week catching up on Battlestar Galactica webisodes.

The staff was uniformly friendly and helpful in giving me directions and charging items from the miniscule “gift shop” to my room (I recommend the local beer). All told, an unexpectedly fine experience for a not-very-expensive hotel, with one puzzling exception - couldn’t they provide toilet paper that didn’t resemble sand paper?
