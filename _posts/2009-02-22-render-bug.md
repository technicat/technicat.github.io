Here’s a case where a render bug actually renders a bug.

It is reminiscent of the [first “actual” software bug](http://www.history.navy.mil/photos/images/h96000/h96566kc.htm), a moth found inside a computer.

I thought I might apply some strong filtering and create something like a Rorschach test. The result looks surprisingly not like a bug.
