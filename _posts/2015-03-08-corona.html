<p>Obscured by the GDC free-engine announcements from Unity and Epic, Corona is now also free, so I played around with it a bit this past week. It&rsquo;s strength is in 2D games but it&rsquo;s also appealing as a cross-platform app solution (I&rsquo;ve given up on Xamarin Forms for now). Programming in Lua doesn&rsquo;t have the practicality of the C# code-sharing arrangement I have with Xamarin and Unity, but it is kind of cool, and the code is succinct.</p><p>If you&rsquo;re used to the nice build-and-run of Unity and Xamarin, the build-and-manually-install of Corona is a little inconvenient. A bigger problem is that building to Android fails on my Mac with a popup saying I need to downgrade to Java 6, even though I&rsquo;ve been running Java 8 with Android dev with no problems.They do have public daily builds, which is really cool, so maybe that&rsquo;s a change in the works. Another inconvenience, which is probably intended to be a convenience: the iOS bundle ID is derived from the provisioning profile, so you can&rsquo;t use profiles with wildcard IDs. I would happily type in an extra lua table value (which is how the other build parameters are set) in order to avoid a trip to the Apple developer site.<br/></p><p>So for now, I think I&rsquo;ll stick with my current Xamarin, Â Unity and maybe a bit of Swift setup. But my Xamarin subscription runs out in a few months, so maybe then&hellip;</p>
