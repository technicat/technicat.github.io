The variety of questions I see on the Internet - I’m thinking of the Unity forums in particular - reminds me of the range of classroom questions I witnessed in college. The best questions are questions that contribute information, show you’ve put some research and thought into it, and steers the conversation into interesting areas (much appreciated if the lecture is getting dull or bogged down by uninteresting questions). Like “Why couldn’t you do it this way?” or “What are the tradeoffs in that approach?” (questions I like to throw back during quiz interviews, by the way).

The worst questions display laziness (seriously, I can’t believe people will put in the effort to repeatedly ask a question loudly but not bother to just google it), a lack of interest in actually learning anything (“all I want is..”) and an assumption that everyone else has nothing better to do than cater to your needs (“can someone help me”, “can someone else help me?”, “help!” and so on…)

The noise-to-signal ratio increased when Unity made their Indie product free, although I think the quality of posts may have swung back a bit - perhaps the forum is self-stabilizing in some manner (this is where Spock would say “…fascinating…”). Nevertheless, it reminds me of my master’s program in computer science at Johns Hopkins. At it’s most challenging, I attended an advanced algorithms class where each session the lecturer (Professor Rao Kosaraju, well known for both his research and teaching) walked us through a proof pointing to each of us in succession to explain the next step (I had to run through the proof in advance in my head to be ready for my turn, but then the professor asked me to explain three steps in a row - guess he had me figured out).

But then I signed up as a teaching assistant for Computer Literacy 101, taken by freshman and psych majors to fulfill a requirement. A few students showed a genuine interest and sense of accomplishment when they got their programs working, and to be honest I didn’t entirely mind some of the women wheedling me for help (but really, c'mon, you’re not in high school anymore). However, the students who just yelled “TA! TA!” whenever they wanted help were incredibly annoying, and we TA’s did our best to pretend not to notice them). My least favorite moment was the extra session I held before the finals, which I rasped through with a nasty cold, where some students weren’t interested in discussing any subject matter unless I told them it was definitely going to be on the test. That’s a shame, especially since the course was really pretty general and included the history of computing, which should have been intriguing even to liberal arts majors (I’ll give you as an example three words: Countess Ada Lovelace). Anyway, in school or out, don’t be that student.
