Upon recommendation from a [Unit](http://unity3d.com/)y forum thread on the vagaries of iPhone memory usage, I went looking for an app called Free Memory. I couldn’t find it, or didn’t bother to find it, in the pile of search results, victim of all the apps with “free” in their names or perhaps the fact there are now over 100,000 apps in the store. (can anyone say “gold rush”?)

Instead I settled for an app called Memory Status. The following two screens should give you an idea why big apps or even unlucky small apps can crash. Even though you’re running one app at a time, there’s other stuff still running, and after a while your available pool of memory (inactive+free) shrinks and shrinks. Tapping the little info icons gives you a brief description of each category of memory state.

This is the part that is supposed to make you feel like you’re back in control. The interface looks pretty polished, with those icons at top bobbing up and down, which I guess indicates they’re getting cleaned. Hard to tell exactly what’s going on, though, since while they’re bobbing I can tap on the broom and vacuum cleaner icons repeatedly to cancel/start a clean.

But looks like it did something. Switching back to the memory view (and hitting the refresh button at top right - I’m surprised I have to do that - shouldn’t it refresh when I’m switching back to this view?), looks like I got a whole boatload of memory back. Next time I run low on memory I’ll probably still just reboot - I doubt any tool can clean better than that - but I think this will still be useful for checking, well, memory status. Good name.
