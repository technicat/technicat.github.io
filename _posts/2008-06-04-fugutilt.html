<p>The latest version of <a href="http://www.apple.com/downloads/dashboard/games/fugutilt.html">FuguTilt</a>, my first <a href="http://unity3d.com/">Unity</a> game, was listed as an <a href="http://www.apple.com/downloads/dashboard/">Apple Staff Pick</a> today. New stuff: dynamic shadows using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadow_mapping">shadow maps</a>, and a new font from <a href="http://www.macxware.com/site/index.html">MacXWare</a>&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.macxware.com/site/products/FontLibrary/overview.html">FontLibrary</a></p>

<p>Originally, I made a point of keeping all my Mac widgets as small as possible, under 1MB, which was kind of an interesting exercise. But I&rsquo;ve given up on that (especially after adding sound), so now I&rsquo;m trying to pretty it up a bit.</p>
