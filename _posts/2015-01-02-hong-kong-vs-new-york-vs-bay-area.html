<p>My 2014 was distinguished by living in three disparate regions: Hong Kong, New York/New Jersey, and the Bay Area. If you happen to be deciding where to live among those places, here&rsquo;s a comparison:</p>

<p>Real estate: They&rsquo;re all expensive.</p>

<p>Weather: Hong Kong is hot and humid, with winters not too hot but still humid (it&rsquo;s funny to watch people there put on their big puffy winter jackets for sub-seventy temperatures, and yet young women still wear short shorts and skirts). Prepare to sweat all year round. NY/NJ is humid in the summer, rains alot, and I got of Dodge before winter hit. Bay Area has near perfect weather except there&rsquo;s this ongoing drought, so I want it to rain. It&rsquo;s actually a bit chilly in the winter, but I&rsquo;ll take it.</p>

<p>Pollution: When I grew up in Southern California, we had smog alerts in the summer that sometimes were severe enough to include a stay-indoors advisory. That is a common occurrence in Hong Kong. Every time I arrived back in San Francisco, just breathing the airport air felt like a cleansing. Even NY/NJ feels fresher, except the subway stations.</p>

<p>Subways: Hong Kong is the clear winner when it comes to subways. Their subway system is considered by some to be the best in the world: clean, air-conditioned, runs like clockwork, and many of the stations are essentially malls. In New York subway stations, I tried to stand near the entrance to get just the slightest whiff of a fresh air. And then you get the crazy people who are yelling at top volume something about the Bible or some story that involves you giving them money. But both are crowded, so for a relaxing ride, I like the Bay Area BART and Caltrain.</p>

<p>Cars: I have no idea what&rsquo;s involved in owning a car in Hong Kong. I assume it&rsquo;s not easy, but one thing, they do have cheap labor, so there was a guy at work who just wiped down everyone&rsquo;s cars. I suppose you might get that as concierge service in some Bay Area companies. This is one of my biggest complaints about NY/NJ. Setting aside the parking issues in New York (and even New Jersey - my apartment management spent three months telling me they&rsquo;d have a parking spot for me soon), it was a real hassle even contemplating getting a car in New Jersey. First, they had a complicated point system in providing identity verification just for a drivers license (old license is 2 points, passport is 3 points, something like that). And then they took away my California license.</p>

<p>Fortunately, California is more mellow - when I returned and said New Jersey took away my license, they just looked me up in their system and ordered me up a duplicate. And State Farm, my insurer of 19 years in California, refused to give me insurance in New Jersey (which would have cost twice as much, too). So much for customer loyalty.</p>

<p>Food: Hong Kong of course has the best and most plentiful Chinese food and has good Japanese options (sushi is really popular), and others like Thai and Vietnamese, although I didn&rsquo;t see any Korean. In fact, my favorite burger place there was Mos Burger, a Japanese chain (although the only competition I saw in the burger arena was McDonalds and Burger King). If you want a fish taco, options are limited (but there are a few).</p>

<p>On the other hand, in New York the only reference I saw to a fish taco I heard was someone exclaiming how they saw this weird thing called a fish taco on the menu. New York does have its Chinatown and Koreatown, and I frequented a Japanese cafe, but it&rsquo;s a bit pricey (I paid $10 for bahn mi from a Vietnamese food truck, whereas you can get one for $2 in Orange County). In comparison, food in Hong Kong is dirt cheap. The Bay Area is in between, price-wise, and I&rsquo;d say has the best comprehensive offerings if you count Chinese, Japanese, and Indian (not much Korean here). Winner: Southern California.</p>

<p>Professionally: the tech scene is of course better in the Bay Area, hands down. If you&rsquo;re an investment banker, sure go to New York or Hong Kong.</p>

<p>And my favorite thing about the Bay Area (and California in general): people here don&rsquo;t assume I&rsquo;m not American. In Hong Kong, it just did not compute - they assumed because I couldn&rsquo;t speak Cantonese I was from the mainland, from Taiwan, from Singapore, or (usually) Japan. And once Australia, for some reason. New York wasn&rsquo;t much better - my favorite question was &ldquo;Are you Korean? I&rsquo;m thinking about buying a Korean car.&rdquo; And I couldn&rsquo;t go to a Chinese restaurant in Jersey City without customers assuming I worked there (to be fair, the owners did offer me a delivery job). California, this is where I belong.</p>
