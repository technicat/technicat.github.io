I wasn’t bluffing - after getting a telemarketing call from Time Warner two nights ago, I marched (well, drove and sauntered) down to the TW retail store to return my cable model and cancel my Roadrunner service. I figured, righteousness aside, I’m in between contracts, and my standard operating procedure is to stock up on instant ramen and canned soup, and cut out recurring costs, like the $50/month for cable broadband.

However, that didn’t stop TWC from calling me again that very evening. Now even if I wasn’t on their do-not-call list, it seems pretty silly to call me two nights in a row. Perhaps they though I had a change of heart overnight? Anyway, the guy seemed nervous so I let him rattle off his spiel (I also do that when the caller is a woman with a sexy voice - telemarketing strategists take note), and then I asked him how I could stop them from calling me “once and for all”. Like the previous caller, he just recited their official mantra - “Time Warner takes do not call requests seriously” (obviously, they don’t) - and that he would put me on the list. When I protested that I’d asked to be on that list for the last three years, he said “I’m just reading you want I’m allowed to”. But then I went a step farther than usual and called customer service to confirm if I’m on their do-not-call list, and the rep there did. But when I asked why I’m still getting call, all he had to say was the blatantly obvious, “you shouldn’t be getting those calls”, (at least it was a step up from the blatantly untrue) and that he was going to update my do-not-call entry (to what, “do not call, and he really means it?”).

So it wasn’t a total waste of time - if they call again, I’ll state that I’m already on the do-not-call list so why are they calling me (and none of that, oh, it takes 30 days for that list to take affect). And I verified that my replacement Samsung Vibrant phone worked before I sent back the old one.
