La Petite Baguette is the third in my series of apps made for myself, all of which were made with AppMakr. The first is Unity Feed, a collection of the official Unity RSS feeds (news, blogs, forum, feedback and answers sites), and the second is Blue Mars News, a similar collection of feeds for the virtual world Blue Mars (a little prettier since it has YouTube and Flickr feeds). I diligently use those apps every day for my work (admittedly while ensconced on my sofa watching TV). But the app I check first thing in the morning is this one, La Petite Baguette, named after the[local French sandwich shop](http://lapetitebaguette.com/), to see their soup of the day (if it’s ham and lentil, I’m there). But while the Blue Mars and Unity apps got approved without comment, La Petite Baguette got the thumbs down:

> Thank you for submitting La Petite Baguette to the App Store. We’ve completed the review of your application but cannot post this version to the App Store because it provides a limited set of features and functionality to users. Its sole purpose is marketing or promoting your product/service which is not appropriate for the App Store, as noted in the App Store Review Guidelines : 2.13 Apps that are primarily marketing materials or advertisements will be rejected

Well, at least now they have these rules in writing, but are they really saying they don’t want any apps that are out there to promote a business? And what about all those “lite” apps whose purpose is to get you to buy the full app? I suspect you could eliminate nearly all existing free apps with that rule, depending how you interpret it, especially apps created AppMakr and including my previous two AppMakr apps. Perhaps there’s some discrimination here - news about virtual worlds and game engines is OK, news about soup and sandwiches isn’t. The owners of La Petite Baguette were enthused when I showed them this app and gave their permission for me to publish it (including the use of their logo and the inclusion of their menu), so I described it as an “official” app, assuming that would increase the odds of getting it approved. But after this rejection, it occurred to me that might have backfired. Maybe it’s better to call it an authorized “fan” app, which is basically what I did with the Blue Mars and Unity apps. So I replied to Apple with that clarification and they replied (while approval can take 1-2 weeks, they respond to clarification questions almost immediately):

> Hello Philip, Thank you for your email and additional explanation. While your application is still considered to be in violation of 2.13 of the App Review guidelines, adding some additional interactive utility by iPhone, and iPod touch users would give your application enough functionality for us to be able to allow it on the App Store. We recommend adding something such as an interactive map (using Core Location) that shows the user’s location and their proximity to this restaurant with directions to the restaurant, or a means of placing an order from within the app, or some other functionality that will allow users to interactively use the app.

So, not for the first time, I have to consider whether it’s worth investing more time in a free app that may or may not be approved. I don’t have a lot of flexibility with an AppMakr app - I might try adding a Google Map display using PhoneGap, which perhaps is close enough to Apple’s suggestion. Or maybe that time is better spent on an Android version.[![](http://itshardtofondlepenguins.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/IMG_0318.png "IMG\_0318")](http://itshardtofondlepenguins.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/IMG_0318.png)
