I returned from Oklahoma with some cowboy sculpture, a [Frederic Remington](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederic_Remington) from the[National Cowboy Museum](http://www.nationalcowboymuseum.org/).

Despite my growing collection, I’m not really a horse guy (although I remember drawing them frequently as a child, along with the Starship Enterprise and the occasional dinosaur), and I rarely purchase souvenirs, but air travel these days is so annoying, you should have a trophy to show when you arrive home.<!--more-->

This trip was a mixed bag. On the United direct flight from [LAX](http://www.lawa.org/lax/) to [Will Rogers Airport](http://www.flyokc.com/), a flight attendant gave me extra little jars of jam to take with me, though admittedly the jam was part of a snack package given only to first class (I’d taken advantage of a $200 upgrade offer during my online check-in).

On my return flight, I hoped for another chance to upgrade relatively cheaply (the difference at initial reservation time was $1000), but the attendants at the gate studiously ignored me while one of them showed off her daughters to the other.

But you can count on the [TSA](http://www.tsa.gov/) to make any airline attendant look like a concierge. I’ve found TSA agents in Bend, Oregon consistently professional and courteous. And that’s the only place. At [Long Beach Airport](http://www.longbeach.gov/airport/), they’re pretty friendly, but one of them spied a book on ancient Chinese history entitled [Treason by the Book](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/127509.Treason_by_the_Book) and told me I shouldn’t carry that on board (read, much?) LAX is the worst, with rudeness surpassing even that in New York (where I greeted a TSA agent who returned, “move on”).

I once had an early morning flight from LAX, where I was so frazzled while re-donning my shoes and belt that I didn’t realize until I reached the gate that I’d left a bag by the security checkpoint. When I went back to inquire, the airport police officer pointed me to the TSA agents, who simply shrugged and said they hadn’t seen it. Fifteen minutes later, the police officer tracked me down at the gate to inform me they really did have it - they found it and left it in a corner the whole time. Thumbs up for the LAX police, thumbs down for TSA (those warnings about unattended luggage should say “any unattended luggage will be ignored and forgotten by the TSA”)

This time around, I handed my boarding pass to the agent on the other side of the screener who was so busy yelling things like “I’m telling you to come here” and “Pick up your kid, lady” that when she turned around and saw me, she’d forgotten if she’d assigned me for a pat-down, actually saying “Did I tell you to stand here? I forgot.” So I got a thorough pat-down, but at least the patter-downer gave me a courteous thank-you. (That’s the least I expect, short of dinner and a movie)

Even at Will Rogers, where I’d expect some Midwest friendliness, I’ve been frisked and sent on my way without so much as a y'all-have-a-nice-day. This was after my flight had been cancelled and I’d had to exit to get a new ticket and return through security. I always get frisked when I go to the ticket counter and never when I check in online - I’d like to know what kind of profiling system assumes terrorists don’t use the Internet and a guy whose flight is rescheduled is a greater risk on the new flight. Well, maybe I see that last one.

The TSA at Will Rogers remind me of retail clerks not particularly happy with their jobs (while I can’t imagine the TSA at LAX even qualifying for jobs at Walmart). On my recent return, the guy running the X-ray machine pushed all the luggage back, restarted the machine, and waited with a bored expression while I wondered whether he’s waiting for me to push all the luggage back on. And then he stopped the conveyer belt when my Remington statue went through, and I thought oh, no, when they’re through with it, I’ll have a box of statue pieces to display. But instead, he picked up the box and said, “it looks expensive, so I didn’t want it going over the rollers.” Hey, thanks! The spirit of [Will Rogers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Will_Rogers) lives!
