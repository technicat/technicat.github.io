<p>If this isn&rsquo;t the first time you&rsquo;ve seen this blog, you might notice it looks a bit different. The latest Wordpress upgrade clobbered my iFeature theme settings, and then the iFeature update lost some features. After a quick repair job (MVP, minimum viable patching?) it&rsquo;s presentable again (although the blog summary view seems to be out of commission), and I think it looks cleaner since I didn&rsquo;t try resuscitate all of the sidebar adornments I had before. These are the few plugins I&rsquo;m still using:</p>
