<p>I used one of the URL&rsquo;s I have lying around waiting for a purpose and tried out <a href="http://comiccms.com/">Comic CMS</a> on <a href="http://itshardtofondlepenguins.com/">http://itshardtofondlepenguins.com/</a>, filling it with my <a href="http://wordseye.com/">WordsEye</a> images instead of comics, since I can&rsquo;t draw. It looks OK - it seems to me I&rsquo;d have more options by using WordPress, but I am tempted to modify it to display Unity webplayers.</p>
