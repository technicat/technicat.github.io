<p>In the mood for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuisine_of_Vietnam">Vietnamese noodles</a>, I wandered down to <a href="http://www.beachcalifornia.com/sunset.html">Sunset Beach</a> the other day to a restaurant in Pete&rsquo;s Landing only to find it closed. Although <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Saigon">Little Saigon</a> is right next door, it&rsquo;s tough sledding here in <a href="http://www.surfcityusa.com/">Huntington Beach</a> for any Asian restaurant that doesn&rsquo;t serve <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Chinese_cuisine">Americanized Chinese food</a> or have &ldquo;Panda&rdquo; in its name.

So I fell back to Woody&rsquo;s Diner and tried their fish tacos. It&rsquo;s not the obvious place to order fish tacos, but it was all right and I was surprised by the presentation:

If there&rsquo;s one dish that&rsquo;s emblematic of Southern California, I vote for the fish taco. Some of the specialists:
</p><ul><li><a href="http://www.rubios.com/">Rubio&rsquo;s</a> - good fish tacos from a fast food chain. As opposed to bad fish tacos from a fast food chain (Del Taco)</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.wahoos.com/">Wahoo&rsquo;s</a> - Asian/Mexican/Brazilian blend with a surfing vibe</li>
	<li>Taco Mesa - local favorite with a huge selection</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.eatchronictacos.com/">Chronic Tacos</a> - always a line, thought not a personal favorite of mine</li>
</ul>
