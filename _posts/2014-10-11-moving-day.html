<p>Yesterday was a day of a couple of firsts. First first, it was my first time trying out Zipcar (although not the first time I reserved a Zipcar - I cancelled that one). Also my first time driving a Prius.</p>

<p>I was surprised to see only Priuses (Prii?) in the nearby Caltrain parking lot, but it makes sense. Zipcar pays for the gas, and even then, it&rsquo;s the driver&rsquo;s responsibility to keep at least a quarter tank full which can be a hassle, so electric is a win-win (I&rsquo;m looking forward to the Zipcar Tesla)</p>

<p>The Prius is not as fun to drive as my &lsquo;94 Celica (I miss you, baby&hellip;), but it does drive just fine and is really easy to drive. And the dashboard is both well-designed and fascinating, telling you when the battery is discharging and charging and when you&rsquo;re sucking up gas.</p>

<p>I was also pleasantly surprised to see that everything I own fits in the Prius. Next time I move, maybe I&rsquo;ll hit the road in a Prius, Beverly Hillbillies style.</p>
