<p>I get the feeling that if ad strategists had their way, they&rsquo;d strap us down and tape our eyes open to ensure ad views. On the web, that means popup ads, splash screen ads, ads in the middle of articles, ads that disable the browser back button.</p>

<p>But there&rsquo;s actually another time-honored strategy - deception. A classic one is the fake download button. I&rsquo;m dismayed to see this one on the tortoisesvn download site, which actually uses both strategies - the ad is the first thing you see and it fills up the screen, and it would be surprising if you didn&rsquo;t think that was the tortoisesvn download link you were looking for. But if you click on the little &ldquo;i&rdquo; you&rsquo;&rsquo;ll see it&rsquo;s a google ad. Now, I don&rsquo;t understand how google allows ads like that and they disabled my text ad for using the word &ldquo;iPhone&rdquo; (as in &ldquo; iPhone app&rdquo;). They said it was a trademark issue, but I&rsquo;m been wondering about that, ever since I heard Apple was being, er, selective, about references to Android on the App Store.</p>
