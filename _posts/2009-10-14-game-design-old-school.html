<p><em>Written on epinions, June 2003.</em><br/></p>

<p>I have a confession to make. Although I&rsquo;ve spent the past few years working as a video game programmer, I am not the prototypical &ldquo;passionate gamer&rdquo; that game companies target in their job ads. The modern big-budget games like the Tony Hawk, Metal Gear Solid, and Grand Theft Auto series&hellip;I can take them or leave them.</p>

<p>But a trip back in time reveals a few games that hold a place in my heart - Goldeneye on the Nintendo 64, Marathon for the Macintosh, and when I see the aging Centipede arcade game at the local laundromat, goodbye quarters.</p>

<p>So it is with pleasure I see that Richard Rouse has gone old school in his book <strong>Game Design: Theory and Practice</strong>. He augments a lucid exposition of game design principles with advice on game design tools, AI development, project planning, and case analyses of well-known titles such as Centipede, Tetris and The Sims. The former two, especially, are held up as quintessential examples of pure game design.</p>

<p>But the real gems here are the interviews with the designers behind the games. Nostalgia resonates from these conversations - each of these luminaries hail from the good old days when one person, a combination designer/programmer, could develop a game from conception to completion within weeks or months.</p>

<p>Interestingly, the subjects have coped differently with the modern trend toward Hollywood-style blockbuster productions. Ed Logg, the creater of the arcade classics Asteroids, Centipede and Gauntlet, has been content to stay at Atari during his entire video game programming career and stick to his interest - programming &ldquo;to the metal&rdquo; on the latest arcade and console hardware. The irascible Chris Crawford, founder of the annual Game Developers Conference, reacted to the increasingly story-less yet more cinematic style of games by turning his back on the mainstream game development community and spending the last nine years on his project Erazzmatron, a &ldquo;story generator&rdquo;. And Jordan Mechner, author of the literary-flavored Prince of Persia and The Last Express, is now writing screenplays.</p>

<p>Far less attention is paid in this compilation to games in other genres such as fighting, shooting, racing, sports and extreme sports. (Doom/Quake creators John Romero and John Carmack are not even mentioned) Although these titles typically involve higher production values in a studio environment and less unique game design, they do form the vast majority of the game business today.</p>

<p>But perhaps that is the point - they just don&rsquo;t make &lsquo;em like they used to. Now, I think it&rsquo;s time for another trip to the laundromat.</p>
