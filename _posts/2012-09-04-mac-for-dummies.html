<p>The Apple II was a programmer&rsquo;s machine. That&rsquo;s the first thing I did with it when I first saw one in my high school library - sat down, opened the manual, and started learning BASIC. The Mac, for all its wonders, wasn&rsquo;t. No shell, you had to buy and install Apple&rsquo;s Pascal-based dev system or something like Think C. Even Windows was more of a programmer&rsquo;s system, with it&rsquo;s crappy DOS shell and all. But MacOSX was what I&rsquo;d been waiting for - basically a NeXt that wasn&rsquo;t priced $10,000 more than I could afford. A real Unix shell, X Windows&hellip;but now in the quest to iOS-ify the Mac, it&rsquo;s turning into a machine for dummies.</p>

<p>For starters, after upgrading from Snow Leopard to Mountain Lion, I couldn&rsquo;t find my Library directory (excuse me, folder) anymore. It&rsquo;s hidden for my protection, I guess. I had to google to find out I have to hold down the option key with the Go menu down to see it. I had to mess around with the Finder preferences to get the main hard drive (and thus all the directories not inside my user directory) to show up. &ldquo;Save As&rdquo; is gone from the Preview application (or do I have to call it an app now?)  Was it considered too confusing? Now it&rsquo;s split into Duplicate and Rename, which had the unfortunate result that I went straight to Rename and thus clobbered the original version of my image. Save As was actually safer. And I haven&rsquo;t figured out what&rsquo;s the point of the Launcher. I mean, now we have a Dock and a Launcher and I&rsquo;m still going to the Applications directory. And what&rsquo;s going on with the scrollbars? Now you see them, now you don&rsquo;t, and when I see them they&rsquo;re getting in the way of something I&rsquo;m trying to click on. And Apple has had a twenty-year allergy to a second (not to mention third) mouse button but we&rsquo;re supposed to scroll with the mouse now?</p>

<p>OK, now I&rsquo;m ranting. That&rsquo;s what happens when you mess with a perfectly good programmer&rsquo;s m achine.</p>
