I’ve only watched a few, but I’ve been a fan of Korean film since that brief intersection of time when I had paid cable and AZN was still going. But it’s only just recently, while scavenging for free TV on my PS3, that I discovered Korean episodic drama. First I caught a few intro episodes on Crunchroll, and then while trying out a free week of Hulu Plus I discovered they have an even bigger bounty of Korean drama and once you watch episode 2, you get hooked. There’s been a formula in the ones I’ve seen so far. The first episode seems almost slapstick. Then the relationship stuff starts and it’s one tear-jerking romance-crushing romance-lifting rollercoaster ride for twenty episodes. It’s exhausting, and you want to stick your arms into the screen, grab the star-crossed protagonists and yell, what the hell’s wrong with you people! A Breaking Bad marathon is a walk in the park by comparison. And there’s always a love triangle, although it’s more like a love polyhedron. And the young and chipper female protagonist who’s a supposedly plain jane who has at least two guys pining over her, at least one of which is a mildly bad boy unable to express his feelings. Despite being a tomboy, the girl sure cries a lot (but to be fair, the guys cry, too), but has commitment issues because of her desire for independence and self-fulfillment and ends up taking a trip to Europe at the end before settling down (how come no one wants to take a trip to Canada?) There’s a lot of texting and really good-looking food.

My favorite show is The First Shop of Coffee Prince. It’s not just my favorite Korean show, it’s one of my favorite TV shows period (I wonder how much better I’d like it if I understood Korean).
