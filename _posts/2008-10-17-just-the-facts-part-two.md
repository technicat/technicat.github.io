Last week, I saw [Barry Sonnenfeld](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barry_Sonnenfeld) on the [Late, Late Show](http://lateshow.cbs.com/latenight/latelate/) complain about the short attention span of kids these days, what with all the texting and web surfing. I’m with him on that, but then he complained that with the web, people just believe the first thing they read. I don’t know about that - when I google a subject, I get pages of links, and I’m usually motivated enough to at least check a few. Compare that to someone who just watches Fox News all day.

I don’t think the newer generation is particularly research-impaired compared to the old, either. For instance, Sonnenfeld also claimed that McCain and Bush had Osama Bin Laden stashed away in order to be popped out as a trophy just before the election. What kind of fact-checking went into that theory?

And how about that elderly lady at a McCain rally who said she’d heard that Obama is an Arab? She probably got her rumors wrong - the predominant rumor is that Obama is a Muslim (though you’d think that having to publicly disavow his crazy pastor would have settled that). Lost amid the accusations and denials - the assumption that a Muslim running for president is somehow a bad thing. (I can imagine Muslims across the nations saying, “Hey, wait a minute….”)

I seem to have the opposite problem of Obama’s. Whenever I offer the tidbit that I am descended from Chinese Muslims (and apparently by some interpretations, that makes me a Muslim), the reaction is typically an exercise in denial - “No way. You can’t be. How can that be?” It’s as if I said I was a Scientologist (although in LA, I guess that’s no big deal).

Speaking of science fiction, after reading a short story in which everyone was required to relocate every few years so they didn’t set down roots, I had the idea of a society where everyone was required to marry another race, on the theory that there’s no racial strife if it’s all in the family. And then after seeing what happened in the former Yugoslavia, I thought that idea could be extended to religion. I never actually thought up a story, but I still think mixing it up makes things a lot more interesting (think outside the box!) So let me give a shout out to my cousin Ben and his blog, [The Unadulterated Gospel of the World’s Greatest Chinese Jew](http://benkoo.com/).
