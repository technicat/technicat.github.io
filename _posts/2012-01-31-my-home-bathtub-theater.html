<p>I finally figured out a useful place for my Apple TV - in the bathroom, where my cable TV can&rsquo;t reach. Not only can I soak in the tub and watch shows or listen to tunes, the bathroom acoustics make it clearly audible even outside the bathroom (my Apple TV is singing in the shower&hellip;) - I&rsquo;m listening to WSJ right now while I&rsquo;m blogging in my home office&hellip;</p>
