I got a nice [developer interview](http://www.appcraver.com/phil-chu-talks-about-developing-apps-and-unexpected-successes/) published with AppCraver yesterday. It’s my third one so far, so I’m averaging perhaps one interview a year. It’s one of the more fun aspects of (self) promotion, and I enjoy reading other developer interviews. As with the Game Developer postmortems, it’s interesting to see what others do and how it turned out. So check out the other [AppCraver interviews](http://www.appcraver.com/ios/interviews/).
