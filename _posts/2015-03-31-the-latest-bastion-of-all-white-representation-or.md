The latest bastion of all-white representation (or in Hollywood parlance,&nbsp;“non-ethnic”), I’ve noticed is eyeglass modeling. On my optician’s walls and on the eyewear websites I’ve browsed, the photos all look like this. To be fair, it’s not a WB-white look so much as mannequin tan. Actually, they don’t quite look human (there’s an Uncanny Valley thing going on), and if the glasses are supposed to make them look smart, they somehow seem to have the opposite effect.
