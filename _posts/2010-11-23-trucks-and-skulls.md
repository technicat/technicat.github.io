I’ll state the obvious that every other reviewer has said - Trucks and Skulls is Angry Birds with trucks and skulls. Now, my head-to-head comparison is flawed because I’ve only played the free version of Angry Birds, on my Android phone, and just for a little bit, while I’m running the full “HD” version of Trucks and Skulls on my iPad, and everything looks better (and sometimes plays better) on the iPad. That said, I spent a lot more time playing Trucks and Skulls, running through a lot of levels until they started to look the same (I’m a lousy gamer, which leads me to suspect the game might be too easy, or at least easier than Angry Birds), the graphics are spiffier, and there are more explosions, in the form of fuel-carrying and bomb-dropping trucks.

But as a developer, I really like to see good stuff in the credits, in this case a listing of open source middleware used (Box2D for physics and ShareKit for social networking) and a link to one of the contract programmers, [One Girl, One Laptop Productions](http://www.quinndunki.com/OGOL/Home.html). That’s a pretty cool name for one-person game dev outfit. I wish I’d thought of something similar, like OneGuyTwoLaptopsAndAnOldMacMiniPlusTwoIPodTouchesAndAnIpad. Never mind, sounds like a really bad sitcom.
