<p>One of my longstanding dubious theories is that I can learn a new language by watching TV shows in that language. That hasn&rsquo;t worked with Telemundo, but I&rsquo;ve managed to pick up a few Korean phrases by watching Korean dramas. I guess if you watch a format that extends from 20-50 episodes, and often more than an hour per episode, you&rsquo;re bound to absorb something.</p>

<p>But I wish I found this Kdrama Talk iOS app before I started. It features a comprehensive glossary of recurring Kdrama terms and some quizzes. If you&rsquo;re wondering whether diarrhea and farts occur frequently in Korean dramas, the answer is, not as much as amnesia, but pretty often. Who says melodrama and toilet humor don&rsquo;t go together?</p>
