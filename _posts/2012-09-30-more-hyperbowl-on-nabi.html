<p>A while ago I placed HyperBowl on the Nabi tablet for $.99, but as with other Android app stores, it doesn&rsquo;t seem like people there want to pay for apps, so now HyperBowl Lite is there. Since the tablet is targeted to kids, I didn&rsquo;t really want to do that, but on the other hand, it&rsquo;s probably safer in that respect than in in-app purchase system. Oh, well, what can you do&hellip;</p>
