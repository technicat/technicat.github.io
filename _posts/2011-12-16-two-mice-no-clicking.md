Another mundane mystery solved - I thought maybe my MacBook Pro was entering its decline (much like my Windows PC’s typically do), since during the last few weeks I’ve had periods where it wasn’t responding to mouse clicks. Actually, just left clicks - right clicks still worked. But after jamming up my trackpad with spilled soy sauce, that rendered my Mac pretty much unusable until I rebooted.

But finally I googled the problem, and it turned out to be a matter of two mice - specifically two bluetooth mice, one which I use at home and one for travel. But if the Mac is connected to both, eventually it stops responding to left clicks, and only left clicks, on the one I’m using. That’s pretty weird, but now I know.
