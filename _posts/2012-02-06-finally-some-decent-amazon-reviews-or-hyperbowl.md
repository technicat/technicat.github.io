Despite the decent December sales, the low ratings for [HyperBowl](http://hyperbowl3d.com/) on the Amazon Appstore have been irritating, and totally out of whack with the ratings on all the other app stores (for example, it averages 4-5 stars on the Nook store). But now it’s getting better - here are the latest 5 and 4 star [Amazon reviews](http://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B005XQ9D5E):

> I think it is awesome also creative.I think it is dumb that people put a rating as 1.HYPERBOWL IS AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!! whoever wrote those other comments are nuts. This game is awesome!! I play it at least 10 times a day!! IT’S AWESOME!!!

I love it when customers come to your defense!
