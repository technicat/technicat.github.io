<p>The Unity Penelope demo looks pretty good from its top-down vantage, so I thought I&rsquo;d try it out as a <a href="http://hyperbowl3d.com/">HyperBowl</a> lane, first as a <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/hyperbowl-penelope/id629387551">free app</a> and then added to the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/hyperbowl/id344209253">paid version</a>. Turns out it looks pretty good from ground level, too, but I don&rsquo;t know about the gameplay. In fact, I got it running last year and held off on releasing it because I didn&rsquo;t think the gameplay was really working. There&rsquo;s no clear path from the ball to the pins, so I put in some boost areas to launch ball in that general direction. But I figured recently, I put that much work into it, so why not, maybe some people will like it. And I was a little surprised to get some good reviews. So I guess I&rsquo;ll keep it, although I&rsquo;m still thinking maybe I should remove the center structure and see if it plays better that way</p>
