Each Unity update has some big feature, like the Asset Store, or in today’s 3.4 release, Substance integration. But my favorite features are the little things, usually in the form of new options in the Player Settings. This time around it’s the autorotation option - now I can toss the script I’ve been using to autorotate my apps on the iPad (Apple rejects them, otherwise).
