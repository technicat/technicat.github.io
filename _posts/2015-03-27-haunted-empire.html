My rating: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1195384486">4 of 5 stars</a><br/><br/>
This book directs a much-needed focus on the negative aspects of Apple&rsquo;s impact on the world, particularly the pressures brought to bear on Asian manufacturers and juicily brings to light the discordant elements of Apple&rsquo;s internal politics, but if seems too grimly determined to cast a dour look on Apple, I think unfairly characterizing the current management&rsquo;s capabilities out of hand and dismissing the company&rsquo;s chances. Basically, it&rsquo;s just too melodramatic, as evidenced by the chapter recounting the forlorn Foxconn life of a young woman in China - I spent most of the chapter expecting it to end in her suicide, coming as it did after the chapter listing Foxconn suicides, and thankfully it didn&rsquo;t, but really, it was an unnecessary detour (it could just as well have been a separate book, fiction or non-fiction) and as much an indictment of China and Chinese culture as Apple. Still, it provides a welcome alternative to the worshipful treatments of Apple and Jobs.
