<p>After an 8pm call from the timeshare desk at the Costa Mesa <a href="http://www.marriott.com/">Marriott</a>, I dashed off a complaint on the Marriott website. Setting aside how I got on a list of &ldquo;interested owners&rdquo;, I&rsquo;m surprised they still call their telemarketing department the Telemarketing Department. Didn&rsquo;t they get the memo: people hate telemarketers? And you gotta love their moxie - instead of say, apologizing and giving me a few Marriott Reward points, they just try to sell me something else at the end of their email.
</p><blockquote>Dear Philip Chu:

Thank you for your inquiry.  I have forwarded your request to our
Telemarketing Office so that they may remove you from their list of
interested owners.  If you have additional questions or concerns you may
reach our Telemarketing Department at 800-798-2690.

Best regards,
