<p>It&rsquo;s not often that I experience buyer&rsquo;s remorse after a trip to the Apple Store, but I think my purchase of an Apple TV was a mistake. The demo didn&rsquo;t look that interesting in the store, but the device itself sure looked cool, and dare I say, cute. Then there was all the hype about its announcement, it was sold out when I first asked about it at the store, and at $99, I figured, why not.</p>

<p>First of all, unusual for an Apple product, my first experience was marred by the lack of an included HDMI cable. OK, the store rep did ask me if I needed one, but I thought I had one or two at home already and I didn&rsquo;t want to buy one unnecessarily. So I unpacked the Apple TV, plugged it in, looked around for an HDMI cable and couldn&rsquo;t find one, and thus the box lay around for a week. Then the Apple effect kicked in again - I was going to get a cable from any old store, but out of curiousity I checked the Apple Store online and saw the Apple-branded HDMI cable got some rave reviews (for a cable?), so I went back to the Apple Store just to pick up a cable.</p>

<p>The setup was pretty easy, and the remote is tiny and simple (reminiscent of an early iPod nano) although it&rsquo;s no fun typing in iTunes and wifi logins with the thing. I entered my YouTube account, too, but the YouTube interface is limited, just showing Favorites and Featured, not, for example, My Videos. And I felt slightly nauseous after watching a couple of videos, I guess because of the frame rate. I&rsquo;ll stick to my iPad for YouTube viewing.</p>

<p>The main reason for getting the Apple TV, the rental store, is really disappointing. The movies have a limited selection, and all those $1.99 rentals you heard about are a small subset of them, none of which I felt like watching. I checked on of the new releases, Splice, at $3.99, and then looked at a not-so-new release, one of the Stargate movies, which was $4.99. I&rsquo;d rather talk a walk to the nearest Redbox and rent a movie for $.99 (I need the exercise, anyway).</p>

<p>The TV episode selection is even more limited, with only a few networks. No Syfy, for example, Most of the shows are from ABC (many of which I watch for free on the ABC Player on my iPad). The $.99 rental (for 48 hours) is appealing, but consider I&rsquo;ve been downloading episodes on my PS3 for $1.99 each and those are sales. Right now I&rsquo;m getting my money&rsquo;s worth by rewatching a season of Veronica Mars. I did find one episode on iTunes that I did want to watch - the finale of Defying Gravity (can you call the last episode of a prematurely cancelled series a &ldquo;finale&rdquo;?) which was inexplicably missing from the Playstation Store. The rental process wasn&rsquo;t too bad, but it was a little confusing - when I clicked Rent, it prompted for an iTunes login, some credit card info, and then put me back at the Rent screen again. I wasn&rsquo;t sure if I was supposed to click the button again or if that would result in a double-charge (I guess I&rsquo;ll find out). When I did click again, after a short while, it told me it was downloaded and ready to play. I&rsquo;d have felt better if there was some progress indicator and if it was clear whether it was streaming or really completely downloaded. Nevertheless, it played fine, and that was a really good episode - I would have looked forward to a second season of Defying Gravity.</p>

<p>Now, back to Veronica Mars.</p>
