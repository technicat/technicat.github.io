<p>&ldquo;ass clown&rdquo; still reigns supreme as the top search term on this blog, but there are some new entries. &ldquo;mccain mit soda&rdquo; just looks random. &ldquo;some people just ignore you image&rdquo; Â - what&rsquo;s that about? My favorites: &ldquo;weird turtles&rdquo;, &ldquo;weird dinosaurs&rdquo;, and &ldquo;space cheese.&rdquo; Give me an astro burger, hold the space cheese.</p>
