<p>My latest attempt at monetizing my mobile apps (I&rsquo;m way behind, only using iAds and AdMob so far) is the addition of <a href="http://kiip.me/">Kiip</a> Rewards to <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/hyperbowl/id344209253">Fugu Maze</a> on the App Store. The idea is, instead of seeing a banner ad through the whole game or sporadic full-screen (interstitial) ads, you get a little banner popup after completing an achievement or high score that, if tapped on, emails you a coupon, like this (from my testing):</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll have to wait and see how the revenue turns out, but the integration was pretty easy and the developer dashboard is polished. And it&rsquo;s nice to see they have their Unity SDK on <a href="https://github.com/kiip/unity-wrapper">github</a>!</p>
