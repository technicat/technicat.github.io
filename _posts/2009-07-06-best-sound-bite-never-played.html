<p>I felt bad for John McCain when he lost the presidential election (although I voted for Barack Obama - McCain made the decision easy when he picked his running mate, who now looks like a big flake). I felt bad not just because of his impressive history and boy-would-we-have-been-better-off-if-he&rsquo;d-won-the-last-one, but it dismayed me that he was punished in the presidential race for his maverick-ness. After authoring an immigration reform bill with Ted Kennedy, he&rsquo;s been dogged by the word &ldquo;amnesty&rdquo; ever since, especially in the Republican debates where everyone talked about building a fence. In one of those debates, I heard him make one of the finest statements made by any candidate in either party (ignore the one by Tancredo, who came off like Crankredo) - excerpted from <a href="http://ontheissues.org/">OnTheIssues.Org</a>
</p><blockquote>Q [to Tancredo]: Would you advertise for your campaign in Spanish? Specifically, I’m referring to the highly publicized comment you recently made that Miami was like a third world country.

TANCREDO: No, I would not advertise in Spanish. English is the glue that keeps a country together, any country. McCain’s immigration bill codifies Pres. Clinton’s executive order that said all papers produced by the government have to be in various languages.

McCAIN: Well, first of all, muchas gracias. We have to stop the illegal immigration, but we’ve had waves throughout our history. Hispanics is what we’re talking about, a different culture, a different language, which has enriched my state where Spanish was spoken before English was. In Washington DC, go to the Vietnam War Memorial and look at the names engraved in black granite. You’ll find a whole lot of Hispanic names. They must come into country legally, but they have enriched our culture and our nation as every generation of immigrants before them.</blockquote>
I remember that speech a bit differently - as I recall, he started off by saying &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s be frank, when we talk about illegal immigrants, we&rsquo;re talking about Hispanics&rdquo;, before pointing out that Hispanic names are on the Vietnam War Memorial and many are currently earning their citizenship while fighting in Iraq. But of course the media didn&rsquo;t quote him at all on this, just the usual piss-poor practice of playing sound bites.

Obama, on the other hand, started off on board with the McCain-Kennedy bill and then nimbly stepped off by tacking on a union-appeasing amendment that helped kill it, allowing himself to alternately take credit for it and distance himself from it when convenient. Every campaign statement he made expressing some sympathy for immigrants was meticulously accompanied by a mention of the American worker who shouldn&rsquo;t have to worry about losing their job to one (and what job would that be?) Even poor Hillary was victimized a bit on this issue - in one of the Democratic debates, Obama was one of those who leapt to the attack when she didn&rsquo;t want to give a simple yes-or-no answer to &ldquo;Do you support driver&rsquo;s licenses for illegal immigrants&rdquo; and then immediately after, when the question was turned to him, managed to evade it with a not-so-fast-it&rsquo;s not-a-simple-issue. While not exactly a ringing endorsement for &ldquo;change&rdquo;, it shows you how the pros do it.

In the meantime, I recently saw McCain giving a speech about controlling the excesses of Big Pharma, and he&rsquo;s been one of the more vocal supporters of the protesters in Iran. It&rsquo;s nice to see him back in the Senate.
