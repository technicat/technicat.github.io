<p>After my latest home office reorg, I now have my Apple TV next to my MacBook Pro, which somehow seems right except that the Apple TV remote also wants to control my Mac. It&rsquo;s pretty annoying to have iTunes pop up every time I try to watch a movie. But I had to do some googling to figure out how to avoid that - turns out the place where that is enabled/disabled is in Settings-&gt;Personal-&gt;Security. If it&rsquo;s a security option, shouldn&rsquo;t it be off by default?</p>
