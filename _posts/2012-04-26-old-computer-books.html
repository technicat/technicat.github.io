<p>I&rsquo;m conducting my spring cleaning and getting rid of programming books that are no relevant (goodbye J2ME). Garbage collecting, as it were. It&rsquo;s interesting to see that my oldest books are still relevant (again, the GC analogy applies - older references tend to stick around, newer ones are more likely to be ephemeral). Thanks to Linux especially, but also to MacOSX, the GNU and X Windows stuff is still around (not so much Motif, but it has descendants in KDE, if I recall correctly). Lisp is still around, even though it&rsquo;s not going as strong as I&rsquo;d like (I wish I still had my copy of the original Lisp Machine Manual). My collection of Inside Macintosh books - OK, that&rsquo;s nostalgia. And the Microsoft books? That&rsquo;s just out of fear that I might have to look at some old code.</p>
