<p>I&rsquo;ve received some compliments on the logo for <a href="http://www.fugugames.com/">Fugu Games</a>, so I thought it might be instructive to show the intermediate versions created by Shane Nakamura of<a href="http://www.shanenakamuradesigns.com/"> Shane Nakamura Designs</a> before the final version.</p>

<p>After asking me some questions to figure out what I was trying to communicate in a logo, Shane came up with a first pass of various ideas. He deliberately left them uncolored to avoid &ldquo;coloring&rdquo; my perceptions of these possible directions.</p>

<p><a href="http://itshardtofondlepenguins.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/fugu_logos_r01.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-914" title="fugu_logos_r01" src="http://itshardtofondlepenguins.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/fugu_logos_r01.jpg" alt=""/></a></p>

<p>I really liked the cute round fugu character - I think it communicates the playfulness appropriate for computer video games (especially since I&rsquo;m making casual, non-violent games). And I preferred the one with the vertical aspect ratio - I can&rsquo;t really articulate why except that the border and lettering have a nice clean look.</p>

<p>But I also thought the side profile looked beautiful, in particular the one with the background that gave it a sort of classic Asian art look. So Shane made second pass with both logos in various colors.</p>

<p><a href="http://itshardtofondlepenguins.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/fugulogos02color-copy.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-915" title="fugulogos02color-copy" src="http://itshardtofondlepenguins.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/fugulogos02color-copy.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="647"/></a></p>

<p>In the end, I chose the cute guy (Shane suggested the name &ldquo;Fugu Phil&rdquo;), for the Fugu Games logo and registered that as a trademark. I think that was the right choice, as I received good comments when I submitted the logo to the <a href="http://www.igda.org/studios/">IGDA studio affiliate site</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://itshardtofondlepenguins.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/fugulogo_front.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-917" title="fugulogo_front" src="http://itshardtofondlepenguins.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/fugulogo_front.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="656"/></a></p>

<p>The side profile is more common among other products that use the &ldquo;fugu&rdquo; name. But Shane&rsquo;s version is much better-looking than any of those, so I asked him for a final version of that one too, just in case I could find a use for it. I was thinking maybe t-shirts, coffee mugs, but it turns out the aspect ratio makes it perfect for the background splash/loading image on my <a href="http://www.fugugames.com/unity.html">web games</a>.</p>
