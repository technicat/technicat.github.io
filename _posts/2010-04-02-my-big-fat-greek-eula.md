I don’t have a lot of nice things to say about EULA’s or TOS’s, but I’ll say one thing about Apple - their general reputation for good user interfaces extends to EULA display. Nothing fancy, but they generally present them in a large window that is actually suitable for reading a document, like the one I just read for my iTunes update.

You might say of course, what’s the big deal, but then I started up Microsoft Works on my new Windows laptop and got a lengthy EULA displayed in a tiny text window you usually see with installers, except this is a startup window. The fact that the window is non-resizeable might lead one to conspiracy theories. I can’t imagine anyone actually bothering to scroll through a few lines at a time to read the entire agreement, which I’m sure is the point.

And then I decided to take enter some tax deductions and started up Deduction Pro, which isn’t even a real app anymore but takes you online (yes, I really want to put my financial information on your web site!). In a browser, the inappropriate tiny size of the EULA window is ridiculously obvious. There’s barely enough room to display “PLEASE READ CAREFULLY”. Yeah, right.
