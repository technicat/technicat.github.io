<p>To get in on the <a href="http://www.pcworld.com/businesscenter/article/249243/rim_offers_free_playbook_to_attract_android_developers.html">free Playbook offer</a> that expires today, I tried to run <a href="http://hyperbowl3d.com/">HyperBowl</a> through Rim&rsquo;s Android online repackager, but no go - apparently it can&rsquo;t handle native code. So for now, I guess if you want your Unity game on the Playbook, you&rsquo;ll have to rely on Unity to port it through their <a href="http://blogs.unity3d.com/2011/05/03/first-wave-of-union-games-for-blackberry-playbook-revealed/">Union</a> program.</p>
