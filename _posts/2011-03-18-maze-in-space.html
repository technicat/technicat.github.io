<p>With the iPhone App Store, I started out submitting little apps like <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/app/fugu-maze/id295808255?mt=8">Fugu Maze</a> to get the hang of it before submitting my big app, <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/hyperbowl/id344209253?mt=8">HyperBowl</a>. That worked out fairly well. With the Mac App Store, I started out with HyperBowl, and so far it hasn&rsquo;t been promising. It took a while just to get it working because I&rsquo;d made so many changes since the last stable version in December, the mouse movement values Unity gets from the Magic Mouse are problematic (I basically ask you if you&rsquo;re using a Magic Mouse, not ideal), and the app was stuck waiting for review for four weeks, so long I was wondering if it was really waiting for review, then it was under review and rejected quickly because the reviewer didn&rsquo;t know how to get out of the menu screen. After I dashed off a reply saying click on the flashing red button, it went back to &ldquo;in review&rdquo;, and has been there for a week.</p>

<p>So I decided oh well, let&rsquo;s try to get something out of that $99 I paid to get on the Mac App Store, and submitted Fugu Maze. There are some differences in submitting a Mac app vs. iOS app, including the screenshots. I suppose it&rsquo;s not really a difference since they&rsquo;re both full-screen, but on a Mac if you&rsquo;re running your app in a window, that means your desktop is showing (pardon me!) With Fugu Maze, I think the result is a nice sci-fi look, a maze lost in space. I hope that doesn&rsquo;t happen to it on the Mac App Store!</p>
