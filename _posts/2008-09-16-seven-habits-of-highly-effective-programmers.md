Iâ€™m pleased to see a [continuing education course](http://dotnet.tech.ubc.ca/CourseWiki/index.php?title=IP352F08A) has listed one of my [essays](http://www.technicat.com/writing/) (by far the most popular one) as its first reading assignment. I wonder what the students wrote?

## Assignments 
To be completed before Monday, September 15th 2008
### Assignment 1 - Programming Concepts
