So far, I’m four for four with five out of five stars reviews on Amazon for my books. But apps still pay better (not great, or even good, but better), so I’m not planning that full-time writing career just yet. Although I’ve received publisher inquiries about writing books on CryEngine and WiX (WiX? I had to look that up).
