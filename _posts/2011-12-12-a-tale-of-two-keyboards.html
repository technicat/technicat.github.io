<p>When it comes to accessories, I usually buy whatever Apple has, but sometimes third-party offerings are just better. For example, Apple just doesn&rsquo;t know how to make mice - or maybe they just don&rsquo;t like mice and are trying to design them into uselessness (&ldquo;the mouse is a nice idea, but let&rsquo;s make it just one button - or better, yet, how about zero buttons?&rdquo;). For mice, I go with Logitech. </p>

<p>Likewise, I tried using an Apple iPad keyboard, but my iPad didn&rsquo;t consistently detect it, it only supported using the iPad in portrait orientation, has a form factor inconvenient for travel, and didn&rsquo;t fit well with the iPad2. So until recently, anytime I had to type anything, I went back to my MacBook Pro. But I spotted a Logitech iPad keyboard at Staples last week that addresses these issues - Bluetooth connection, propping up the iPad or iPad2 in either orientation, the keyboard has a nice solid feel (unlike some of the rubbery ones I&rsquo;ve seen), and it acts as an iPad case, too (just plop the iPad face-down onto the keyboard). I&rsquo;m actually blogging this blog for the first time on my iPad with this keyboard. One step closer to realizing my iPad office! (another step, by the way, is using the Sign &lsquo;n Send app to receive, sign, and email contracts without having to print and scan them).</p>

<p>Here are the Apple and Logitech keyboards, side by side.</p>
