<p>The good folks at the <a href="http://www.westminsterveterinarygroup.com/">Westminster Veterinary Group</a> have taken to my cat Jiggs, so much so that they tend to call me &ldquo;Mister Jiggs&rdquo; on the phone. I&rsquo;ve considered changing my name to save trouble, but I settled instead for registering the domain name, <a href="http://www.misterjiggs.com/">http://www.misterjiggs.com/</a> Not much there except a few cat photos sure to bore anyone who&rsquo;s not into cats, or my cat in particular.</p>

<p>I remember in one of my previous jobs another cat owner and I would start talking loudly about our cats whenever our coworkers started going on about their kids. I don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;d do in that situation if you aren&rsquo;t a pet-owner or parent - find some World of Warcraft players I suppose and go on about that.</p>

<p>In any case, I&rsquo;ll close by inflicting a cat video of Mister Jiggs (actually, she should be called Miss Jiggs):</p>
