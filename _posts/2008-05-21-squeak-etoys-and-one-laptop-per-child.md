It pained me to miss Game Seven between the Hornets and Spurs, yesterday, but I felt I had to attend the [IEEE-OCCS](http://occs.ieee.org/) talk featuring [Alan Kay](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Kay). I mean, it’s Alan Kay - at the legendary [Xerox Parc](http://www.parc.com/), one of the key designers of [Smalltalk](http://www.smalltalk.org/), personal computers with windows and mice (although everyone gets credited with inventing the mouse except the actual inventor, [Doug Engelbart](http://www.ibiblio.org/pioneers/engelbart.html)), conceiving the [Dynabook](http://www.artmuseum.net/w2vr/archives/Kay/01_Dynabook.html) (the first idea of a laptop), Chief Scientist at Atari, Apple Fellow, Disney Fellow, HP Fellow…<!--more-->

Skipping the basketball game turned out to be the right choice, and not just because I was rooting for the Hornets. It’s the first OCCS talk to hold my attention, and one of the few talks I’ve attended where the speaker exuded so much intellect and experience that I felt I was just absorbing knowledge by sitting there, even the grumpy old programmer and dogmatic opinion parts (I got that feeling after listening to [Noam Chomsky](http://www.chomsky.info/), [Marvin Minsky](http://web.media.mit.edu/~minsky/), and…no one else comes to mind)

The talk began with a history of personal computing that was in itself a personal history - from someone who was there with [Ivan Sutherland](http://web.mit.edu/invent/iow/sutherland.html) ([Sketchpad](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sketchpad)), and [Seymour Papert](http://www.papert.org/) ([Logo](http://el.media.mit.edu/Logo-foundation/logo/index.html)) and now involved with the [One Laptop per Child](http://laptop.org/) project (the focus of the talk) run by [Nicholas Negroponte](http://web.media.mit.edu/~nicholas/). The presentation described how all those influences converge with the One Laptop project to form a modern Dynabook, using [Squeak](http://www.squeak.org/) (a modern Smalltalk) to implement [Etoys](http://wiki.laptop.org/go/Etoys), interactive learning software. And throughout the presentation, references to [Gutenberg](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johannes_Gutenberg), [Erasmus](http://www.historyguide.org/intellect/erasmus.html), [Babbage](http://www.kerryr.net/pioneers/babbage.htm), [McLuhan](http://www.marshallmcluhan.com/), [Galileo](http://galileo.rice.edu/)…I want a report on that tomorrow!

Too bad the presentation got dragged down a bit by an argumentative audience member, but otherwise I was inspired to go home, hit the books, and work on my own world-changing software…until I walked out of the meeting room and saw the Hooters swimsuit competition on the hotel restaurant television.
