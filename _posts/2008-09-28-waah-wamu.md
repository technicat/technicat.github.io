I was startled by the[news that Washington Mutual has been taken over and sold](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/7637026.stm) by the feds - startled not so much by the news that they failed, but that they managed to get so big.

Way back before their marketing folks started calling it “WaMu” (and now their banking experience is touted as “whoo hoo”), I involuntarily became a [Washington Mutual](http://wamu.com/) customer after they had taken over my bank Great Western. I stayed while they ruined once-excellent customer service (as others waiting in the suddenly longer lines agreed), but then they started nickel-and-diming me on my overdraft account. I discovered when sending in a payment coupon for the full balance, they charged additional interest for every day after the bill was sent, so you could never pay it off completely without visiting a branch, asking how much you owe now, and paying it off right there. And I figured while I was doing that, I might as well ask them to cancel my account.

A year or so later, I read that state attorneys (from Washington, I think) had sued Washington Mutual for such practices, and there appears to be no shortage of lawsuits and ill will, for example, listed on this [unsightly site](http://www.wamufraud.com/) (although it is designed by a professional web designer!) So you can offer inferior customer service and fleece customers with deceptive practices as long as you keep growing by acquiring (and then ruining) the competition and blow a lot of cash on slick advertising campaigns? It’s hard to believe that it could all fall apart.
