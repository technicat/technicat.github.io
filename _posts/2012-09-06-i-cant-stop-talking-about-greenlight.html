<p>The weird thing about this recent Valve/Steam/Greenlight kerfuffle is that I have little interest in it, but I got caught up in it. I&rsquo;m not even that familiar with Steam - I know what it is, I downloaded Portal, I submitted HyperBowl to Steam and in a few weeks got a thanks-but-sorry-and-we-won&rsquo;t-tell-you-why, but it was no big deal. I wasted a lot more time trying to get HyperBowl on the Mac App Store - they kept rejecting me for this and that until I finally complained to the appeal board and they told me it looked too much like the iOS version and I should start over from the ground up. So I focus on mobile and give the desktop version away for free (just enough to incur a support burden).</p>

<p>And actually, $100 is not bad a for a one-time fee, compared to the recurring Apple $99 fee (and that&rsquo;s one annual fee for iOS and another for Mac), although it&rsquo;s a bit of an apples-and-oranges comparison (you&rsquo;re paying a popularity contest entry fee) plus it goes to charity. Even when it looked like it might be a per-submission fee (they cleared that up now, but more and more I&rsquo;m getting the impression they&rsquo;re just winging it), the charity aspect would seem to make it a worthy expense, if you could afford it. Whether or not people can afford it, there are certain to be complaints, of course - look at all those Unity Indie owners who don&rsquo;t understand why they can&rsquo;t have Pro features (or that dude on YouTube who complained &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not made of a million bucks!&rdquo; when I said I might charge for my game).</p>

<p>But what got my dander up was the reaction to the reaction, basically &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have $100, what&rsquo;s wrong with you?&rdquo;, &ldquo;Steam is for pro&rsquo;s, if you&rsquo;re not a funded team making a AAA game go away&rdquo; and &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the big deal, you&rsquo;ll make a ton of money on it.&rdquo; I can think of a lot of responses, which have already been made by a bunch of people by now, but the short of it is, if you&rsquo;re saying stuff like this, you&rsquo;re probably not an unsalaried game developer (it actually reminds me of the time a coworker asked me why poor people eat at McDonald&rsquo;s as we finished our $15 Thai meal), and don&rsquo;t you have a scrum meeting to go to? If Valve wanted more AAA games, an American Idol type of competition (without the expert panel) is not the way to go about it - remember, they said they instituted the fee to eliminate the joke submissions, not indie non-AAA submissions. Everyone who&rsquo;s projecting their hoighty-toighty standards, get off your high horse, and keep your bewailing-quality comments on gamasutra. And that gold-mine stuff - already went through that with the App Store. Which reminds me, why am I still talking about this? I have an iOS build to finish.</p>
