No, it’s not a poisonous fish smoothie. I wanted try shake detection in&nbsp; iPhone apps (“I need more cowbell!”), so the latest [FuguMaze](http://itunes.com/app/fugumaze) now rescrambles the maze if you shake it, and the latest [WordsEye Feature](http://itunes.com/app/wordseyefeature) loads the next WordsEye image on shake.
