A couple of weeks ago, Gov. Schwarzenegger designated September 23 as <a href="http://korematsuinstitute.org/">Fred Korematsu</a> Day, recognizing his civil rights leadership in resisting the Japanese-American internment of World War II.

Meanwhile, here at Huntington Beach public library , I picked up a copy of the <a href="http://catalog.hbpl.org/ipac20/ipac.jsp?session=1287T10T80R03.408365&amp;profile=cen&amp;source=~!horizon&amp;view=subscriptionsummary&amp;uri=full=3100001~!304792~!0&amp;ri=1&amp;aspect=subtab15&amp;menu=search&amp;ipp=20&amp;spp=20&amp;staffonly=&amp;term=ebb+and+flow&amp;index=.GW&amp;uindex=&amp;aspect=subtab15&amp;menu=search&amp;ri=1">100-year Huntington Beach documentary</a> published by the local historical society, which cheerfully notes how the chili crop production dipped during the war because the Japanese-American farmers were interned, but otherwise life went on as normal. And the book profiled a local Japanese &ldquo;immigrant&rdquo; who was interned (failing to elaborate that citizens were also interned), quoting him as saying &ldquo;it had to be&rdquo; (I&rsquo;d like a second opinion on that translation), noting his &ldquo;associates&rdquo; (his poker buddies, or everyone of Japanese descent on the west coast?) were well-treated by their neighbors (excepting perhaps the Fountain Valley residents who didn&rsquo;t want a Japanese-American soldier buried near his family&rsquo;s home after he&rsquo;d been drafted from camp to serve and be killed in Europe) and some were even offered the option to move inland (the interment sounds like a time-share presentation). Nothing about how that whole internment thing was a really bad idea (there were some who did object - the Orange County Register, Ansel Adams, and, oh yeah, the 120,000 sent to live behind barbed wire)

I had earlier complained to City Hall about the documentary they were broadcasting on local cable, but it turns out that was just a faithful rendition of this book. I just want to hear a &ldquo;My bad, we didn&rsquo;t know what we were talking about&rdquo; but so far I&rsquo;ve only heard &ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing wrong with it&rdquo;, &ldquo;A diverse group of community leaders approved it&rdquo; (have you seen the candidate roster this election? It&rsquo;s blindingly white), and, horrifyingly, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s been sent to local schools&rdquo;. Nice to know that when the next generation takes over, if there&rsquo;s a war with China, I&rsquo;m headed off to &ldquo;camp&rdquo; even though I&rsquo;m an American-born citizen. I&rsquo;m also descended from Muslims on my father&rsquo;s side, so I&rsquo;m doubly screwed (I assume those who are determined to think Pres. Obama is a Muslim would think I am, too). But gosh, I hear everyone was treated really well in those camps, so let me pack my bags!
