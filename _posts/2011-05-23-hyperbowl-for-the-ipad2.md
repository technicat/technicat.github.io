This latest [HyperBowl](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/hyperbowl/id344209253?mt=8) update was largely an exercise in guilt relief. First of all, I finally got around to fixing an embarrassing physics bug I introduced in the previous update. I had added a pause menu and for the iOS version and to bring up the menu I made by the timer HUD element tap-sensitive by adding a collider, but I didn’t set up my collision layers to avoid having that collider interact with the gameply. So if you bowled slowly enough (it’s a very thin collider so you could go right through it), the ball seemed to run into an invisible wall. Just another example of unintended consequences from new features.

The second impetus was to justify getting that iPad2. I didn’t even need my first iPad - it’s great, but my lifestyle is inactive enough without lying on the sofa tweeting and web-surfing while watching TV. But I have to admit I got caught up in the frenzied search for that elusive new iPad. I spotted three sitting in a Target case, walked around for a while to think about getting one, and which one, but when I saw there were only two remaining in the case when I returned, I pulled out my Target card (5% off - that’s more than half of the sales tax!)

It would have been anticlimactic and expensive just to see for myself that the iPad2 runs my apps as well as the first iPad, so I added some additional content just for the iPad2 (or rather, since I convert the master desktop “has everything” copy of the game to iOS, I just leave some more content in with a runtime check for the device). The iPad2 is fast, really fast. Whereas I added content for the original iPad up to the point where it (barely) ran above 30fps, the new iPad2 runs much of that at 60fps. I’m looking forward to adding a lot more in future updates!
