Last week I dropped off my annual donation to [Get Well Gamers](http://www.get-well-gamers.org/), a charity founded by [Ryan Sharpe](http://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=11309) that supplies video games as a pain management tool for children recovering in hospitals. They’re located here in Huntington Beach, so it’s a convenient drive-by for me, I unload all the video games I’ll never get around to playing (everything that’s not the latest generation), and I could use the tax break (it’ll make a tiny dent in what I lost in home and stock market value this year).

A google search for other video game charities proved disappointing, listing more charity events than sustaining charity organizations, but I did find a few that looked promising, e.g. the [Gamers Outreach Foundation](http://gamersoutreach.org/) and another one for hospital-bound children, [Child’s Play](http://www.childsplaycharity.org/). In an industry not exactly known for maturity, it’s encouraging to see some do-gooding.
