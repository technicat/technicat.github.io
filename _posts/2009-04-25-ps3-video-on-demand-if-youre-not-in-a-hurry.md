To my dismay, nay, horror, I found myself left with only four cable stations a few days ago (and two of them are public access). Apparently, the cable company figured out I’m not a paying customer. So I said, now I’ll get some work done.

But first, let me try out the video download feature on my Playstation 3. Most of the movies aren’t much cheaper than the packaged retail version, but I can watch that episode of Dollhouse that I missed for $1.99, or $2.99 for the HD version. Although the product heading says “own”, the description explains the rental policy (24 hours), which is a bit confusing, but I went ahead to checkout, where I first have to fill up my “wallet” with a minimum $5, enter my credit card number via the game controller (talk about button-mashing), and then start the download. “264 minutes remaining”. I can opt to download in the background or start playing the movie while downloading. Hit play - in crisp hi-def I see a reporter saying, “the dollhouse” - buffering, buffering - “is” - buffering, buffering. Forget it, now I’ll get some work done.

But instead, I backed out, put in a Sarah Connor Chronicles DVD, four hours later, go the PS3 download manager - “264 minutes reminaining”. Guess it didn’t continue downloading in the background. Open up the download task, see the progress continue at perhaps 0.5 MB/s (I’m supposed to have 1.5MB/s and the test at speakeasy.net says I have a bit more). Back out of the task, it stops, go back in, it continues, and there’s apparently no way to get it running in the background, now. OK, now I’ll get some work done, but it’s bedtime. So I leave it in there overnight, watch the Dollhouse episode in all it’s glory the next morning.

Now, for tonight, I’d better start downloading now. In the meantime, I’ll watch C-SPAN 2. Or maybe I’ll get some work done.
