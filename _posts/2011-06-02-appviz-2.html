<p>I upgraded to <a href="http://appviz.com/">AppViz 2</a> today, which addresses the two major issues I had with the original AppViz - tracking iAd sales and the lack of a cumulative sales graph that also showed the breakdown among multiple products. The way to show that is in the Dashboard, which now has a customizable time range like the Graph display (and both have convenient drop-down selectors for typical time periods, like last seven days, last 30 days, all, etc.)</p>

<p>The yellow is <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/hyperbowl/id344209253?mt=8">HyperBowl</a>, the red is <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/app/fugu-maze/id295808255?mt=8">Fugu Maze</a> and the orange denotes iAd revenue from <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/fugubowl/id297032758?mt=8">Fugu Bowl</a>, the top speckles at the end are from <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/fugu-maze/id426993175?mt=12">Fugu Maze on the Mac App Store</a>, and the rest are the individual HyperBowl lanes that are now free. Ain&rsquo;t it pretty?</p>
