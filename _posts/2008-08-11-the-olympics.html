<p>I hadn&rsquo;t planned to spend much time watching the <a href="http://www.nbcolympics.com/">Olympics</a>, but it&rsquo;s addictive, and hard to avoid when it&rsquo;s broadcasting on three channels at a time. At one point I switched to CNN only to hear <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/CNN/anchors_reporters/sanchez.rick.html">Rick Sanchez</a>, reporting on the bloody conflict over <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_in_South_Ossetia_(2008)">South Ossetia</a>, explaining &ldquo;Why do we care? Oil.&rdquo; Then I switched back.</p>

<p>I could do without the <a href="http://results.beijing2008.cn/WRM/ENG/INF/GL/95A/GL0000000.shtml">medal counting</a> - I like watching some of the more unusual sports (blowing up clay pigeons with shotguns - what&rsquo;s not to like?). I found fencing both disturbing and fascinating - lightning quick action by figures in what looks like bee-keeping outfits, triggering green and red lights that seem to have no correlation to who actually won the round, and an exultant or frustrated scream by each competitor, I can&rsquo;t tell which. My favorite is the boxing competition. Besides the action and commentary by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teddy_Atlas">Teddy Atlas</a>, I love the sportsmanship shown by the fighters after each match, encouraging each other after victory/defeat and shaking hands with the opposing corner.</p>

<p>For a great Olympic read, see<a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2219561.Rome_1960_The_Olympics_That_Changed_the_World"> Rome 1960: The Olympics that Changed the World.<br/></a> Amid the backdrop of the Cold War and racial oppression in the United States, and many firsts like television coverage and a doping scandal, it&rsquo;s the stories of the individual competitors that stand out, and the camaradie among them, in some cases transcending national boundaries, like the deep friendship and rivalry between <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafer_Johnson">Rafer Johnson</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yang_Chuan-Kwang">C.K. Yang</a></p>
