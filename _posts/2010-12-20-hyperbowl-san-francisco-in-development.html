<p>I&rsquo;ve only made YouTube videos of the first three <a href="http://hyperbowl3d.com/">HyperBowl</a> lanes, so I thought I&rsquo;d catch up. Here&rsquo;s San Francisco running from the Unity Editor, after I added some new collision behavior (crumpling streetlights, fire hydrant turning into a geyser). It&rsquo;s not as smooth as the captures I made of the web players, and the sound was really out of sync after I made the YouTube upload, but hopefully that&rsquo;s one of those postprocessing things&hellip;</p>
