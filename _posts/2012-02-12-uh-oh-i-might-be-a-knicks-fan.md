At first, I thought I must not have been paying attention since I had never heard of Jeremy Lin until a few days ago. But then I found out I’m not alone in that. Now I have to admit I’m caught up in Linsanity - I spent much of this weekend watching YouTube videos of his recent Knicks games, his limited Warrior minutes, his D-league games, summer camp games Harvard games, pickup games…

I admit this is largely due to the Asian-American angle - I liked Yao Ming, too, partly because it was nice to see an Asian guy in the league, and I liked his personality and style of play, but at the time he wasn’t an Asian-American and I didn’t really feel I had anything common with him. For starters, he’s from China and speaks Chinese - I’m American-born and I speak English. When Shaq directed some grade-school level pseudo-Chinese babble at Yao, it probably didn’t bother him but it bugged the heck out of me. And though Yao was one of the more athletic centers, that’s not my least favorite position (I did like Vlade Diva, too, though). Frankly, Tracy McGrady was my favorite Rocket.

Jeremy Lin, though, is a guy like me, insofar he’s American-born, speaks English, and has had to put up with racist taunts (even in Ivy League games) and, even though more well-intentioned, silly nicknames like “Emperor Lin” and whatever Spike Lee was pulling out of cheap martial arts serials. C'mon, the guy is from Palo Alto. African-American NBA players don’t have nicknames indicating they’re from Africa. Steve Nash is actually from Canada and we don’t call him “Maple Syrup” (that’s the only Canadian nickname I can think of).

And speaking of Nash, Lin is a guard in that mold (but bigger and able to dunk), which is another reason I like his play, and considering that he’s now on a D'Antoni team with another ex-Sun, Stoudamire, and after watching highlights of the recent games and the post-game interviews with the coach and players, I’m afraid I’m starting to turn into a Knicks fan, except New Yorkers apparently are insane when it comes to sports (one reason I’m warming to D'Antoni is the way he stood up Jeffries in an interview after that guy got booed) I’m suprised I haven’t heard any cases of any New York Chinese-American basketball fans spontaneously combusting. Oh, wait, I do have an idea for a nickname - “The Linternal Combustion Engine”. No? OK, I’ll stick to watching the videos.
