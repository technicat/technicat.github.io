I saw a tweet from [purplelilgirl](http://purplelilgirl.tumblr.com/) where she’s using [Redeem Now](http://redeem-now.com/), so I decided to try it for my own App Store promo code distribution. You upload your promo codes and get url’s back that you can hand out. One complaint - it’s a real pain to just copy and paste more than one of the links corresponding to the codes. But it does solve the problem of tracking which promo codes have been used, and it’s nice to see some regional info:

I also like the Facebook feature. Always nice to have new fans!
