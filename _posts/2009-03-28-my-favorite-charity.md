My favorite charity at this very moment is [Amnesty International](http://amnestyusa.org/). Just because in a recent mail solicitation from them, I saw something I’ve never seen before - a check-box to opt out of their address-sharing program. To make sure I wasn’t imagining it, I checked their web site and it’s there, too: ![picture-5](http://itshardtofondlepenguins.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/picture-5.png "picture-5")Coincidentally, this arrived shortly after I complained to the [ACLU](http://aclu.org/) about their address-sharing program. They also have an opt-out option - the inconvenient kind, where you have to write in. As with commercial enterprises that make money by renting or selling your address, this is par for the course for non-profits, although [Charity Navigator](http://charitynavigator.org/) does use it as a rating criterion. With the ACLU, it seems a bit hyprocritical, considering their stances on consumer privacy in areas such as medical patient databases. Their privacy statement (and a blurb in their newsletters) reassures:

> We may also share the Voluntarily Submitted Data of members and donors who are U.S. residents with other non-profit organizations and publications (“Sharing Organizations”), but never to any partisan political groups or to groups whose programs are incompatible with ACLU policies.&nbsp;

But that’s terribly vague. For example, at one point during the presidential election I found that [MoveOn](http://moveon.org/) described itself as “non-partisan” on its web site and yet had a Top Ten Things You Should Know About John McCain article that included a factoid that McCain was one of the richest members of Congress, failing to &nbsp;note (besides “so what”) that several Democrats were ahead of him on that [list](http://www.rollcall.com/features/Guide-to-Congress_2008/guide/28506-1.html), including John Kerry and Ted Kennedy (and Jay Rockefeller, no surprise).
