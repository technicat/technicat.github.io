[Elektra Dance](http://itunes.com/app/elektradance) showed up on the App Store last month but with the holidays and all, and since it’s a free app, I didn’t blog about it. Still, it has some interesting history - it started with a sample mocap’d character from my friends at [ElektraShock](http://elektrashock.com/), which I used as the centerpiece of a [Unity web demo](http://elektrafugu.com/).

As with most of my [Unity web demos](http://fugugames.com/unity.html), I submitted it as a Mac widget to the Apple widget site, but they rejected it (that is, they never listed it - that’s how it works there). I figured the problem was the nudity, so I decided to go minimal and remove besides the character everything including the lighting, so it looked kind of like the dancing silhouettes in the iTunes commercials. How could they object to that? Still, a resubmission didn’t work.

Later, when I ported some of my widgets to (mostly free) iPhone apps, I figured, let’s try it again, and submitted it to the App Store. After a couple of weeks, I received an email from Apple saying they needed more time to review it. That’s not a good sign. Four weeks later, I received an email saying it didn’t “have enough functionality.” I figured the problem was still the (implied) nudity. After all, there’s an app that called iMirror(?) that just displays a mirror frame and invites you to see your reflection in the iPhone screen.

But in the past year, Apple introduced an age rating system for apps, so just before Christmas I figured what the heck, give it another try, and resubmitted with a 17+ rating. This time, approved!

So far, it seems to be well received. Since it’s free and I don’t plan to charge for it, I don’t know if I’ll release any updates, but it is tempting to add more music and animation, and I hear the iPhone Enhancement Pack will allow in-app selection of tunes from your own song library (right now you have to select it beforehand). So who knows, stay tuned….
