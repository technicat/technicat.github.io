I get a lot of email asking me to fill out a survey. I never do - it’s like saying, “Thanks for being our customer, would you mind filling out a bunch of forms?”

This email I received from Dark Horse yesterday is the right way to do it. Just give us some feedback in a manner that’s convenient for you, and here’s a token of our appreciation. Now, that token is more a coupon than a prize, and it’s only redeemable on their web store, whereas I prefer to read comics on my iPad, but I’ll save a discussion on why they have two or three different digital stores for another day. In the meantime, even though I probably won’t use the coupon, I’ll try to remember to leave a review for their iOS app.
