I got around to fixing up the ElektraDance web player, showcasing a model and mocap animation from [ElektraShock](http://www.elektrashock.com/), on [Fugu Games](http://www.fugugames.com/).

The moving sun is now a directional light so the terrain is lit properly.

The credits now show streaming video.

I decided to practice what I preach and sync redraws to the monitor refresh. It’s a standard copout, especially on a PC, to not sync when you’re struggling to achieve a decent frames-per-second rate, but you get tearing artifacts, like the leg in the screenshot below. If you feel nauseous playing a game, that’s probably why (I’ve received complaints about that on my non-synced games).

Here’s another outtake - one little change in the animation parameters and the character goes flat and spins like General Zod in space. (come to think of it, the character looks kinda like Lex Luthor)
