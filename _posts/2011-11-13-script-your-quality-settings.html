I have two problem with the Unity Quality Settings. It is inconvenient to change them per-platform and sometimes I want to tweak them per-scene instead of for the entire game.

<a href="http://itshardtofondlepenguins.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/Screen-shot-2011-11-13-at-10.41.03-AM.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5054" title="Screen shot 2011-11-13 at 10.41.03 AM" src="http://itshardtofondlepenguins.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/Screen-shot-2011-11-13-at-10.41.03-AM.png" alt="" width="338" height="806"/></a>

Fortunately, both issues can be resolved by scripting (that wasn&rsquo;t always true - for a while, some of the newer additions to the Quality Settings were not accessable via script). For <a href="http://hyperbowl3d.com/">HyperBowl</a>, I have a script that I attach to each scene with a property value for the shadow distance, since I want to vary that per scene. And I have settings that I want to vary per platform (or override, as in the case of fog on Android) Here, I also set my physics timestep - as with the quality settings, I worry about accidentally losing some of my preferred values, or even, in my more paranoid moments, that Unity has reset them.
<pre>var shadowDistance:float = 80;

function Awake() {
    AdjustRenderSettings();
    AdjustPhysicsSettings();
}

function AdjustRenderSettings() {
// always vsync and use full texture resolution
    QualitySettings.masterTextureLimit = 0;
    QualitySettings.vSyncCount = 1;
#if UNITY_IPHONE || UNITY_ANDROID
    Application.targetFrameRate = 60;
    QualitySettings.pixelLightCount = 0;
    QualitySettings.anisotropicFiltering = AnisotropicFiltering.Enable;
    QualitySettings.antiAliasing = 0;
#endif
#if !UNITY_IPHONE &amp;&amp; !UNITY_ANDROID
// apply per-scene shadow distance on desktop/web
    QualitySettings.shadowDistance = shadowDistance;
#endif
// override per-scene fog on Android
#if UNITY_ANDROID
    RenderSettings.fog = false;
#endif
}

function AdjustPhysicsSettings() {
    Time.fixedDeltaTime = 0.02;
}</pre>
