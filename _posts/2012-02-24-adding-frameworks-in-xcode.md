Every once in a while I have to leave my comfortable Unity cocoon and mess around with XCode. For example, I recently had to add some additional frameworks to XCode after my Unity build to accomodate a plugin. All these modern GUIâ€™s are supposed to take the pain out of software development, but I always end up clicking around in futility on the obvious places, briefly searching the XCode documentation, then googling for it and discarding all the answers relating to previous versions of XCode. Yes, that was easy. Anyway, to add a framework in XCode, click on your target in the left pane, then click on the Build Phases tab on the right, Click on the Link Binary with Libraries tab below, click on the + button in the bottom left of that section.
