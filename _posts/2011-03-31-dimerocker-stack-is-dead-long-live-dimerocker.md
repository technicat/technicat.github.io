I only noticed today that my version of HyperBowl on dimeRocker Stack - the first incarnation of the dimeRocker Facebook platform, is no longer running, so I got to try out the Facebook remove-your-app functionality. I reviewed the announcements on the dimeRocker [developer forums](http://developer.dimerocker.com/) and saw that Stack was scheduled to shut down on March 1, replaced by the dimeRocker Arcade ([HyperBowl](http://apps.facebook.com/dimerocker/play/hyperbowl) is already on it) Hereâ€™s hoping the Arcade lives longer!
