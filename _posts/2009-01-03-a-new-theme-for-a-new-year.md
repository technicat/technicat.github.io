I had a good year, business-wise, but not good enough to start another remodelling project, so I’ll settle for a new [Wordpress](http://wordpress.org/) theme. The old layout was squashing my [WordsEye](http://wordpress.org/extend/themes/) pics, anyway (and when the latest Wordpress update unsquashed them, they started overlapping in an unsightly manner).

Aside from the built-in choices, there are quite a few themes available in the [Wordpress theme directory](http://wordpress.org/extend/themes/). Some of my favorite looks had broken links or didn’t support features I’m using, like link categories, so after killing a few hours, I settled on this one. I should really make my own theme from scratch (graphic design skills permitting). Maybe next year…
