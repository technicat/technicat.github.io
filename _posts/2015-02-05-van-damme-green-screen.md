During my Baltimore days, I was introduced to crabcakes, pistol shooting (at a range, not like in a David Simon show), bikini bars, and Van Damme movies. I just found his green screen clips on YouTube. Good to see the guy again (ah, memories of Time Cop…), seems like there should be some game possibilities here…
