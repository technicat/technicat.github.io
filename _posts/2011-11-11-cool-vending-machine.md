The one time I went to Japan, I was impressed by their more advanced rail systems, toilets, and vending machines. I particularly liked the machines that would microwave fried rice before dispensing it. I’ve never seen anything quite at that level in the US, but this frozen-food vending machine is pretty good (I can’t say the same for the microwavable philly cheesesteak that I selected - I should have just got some ice cream)
