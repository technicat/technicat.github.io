I’ve only made YouTube videos of the first three [HyperBowl](http://hyperbowl3d.com/) lanes, so I thought I’d catch up. Here’s San Francisco running from the Unity Editor, after I added some new collision behavior (crumpling streetlights, fire hydrant turning into a geyser). It’s not as smooth as the captures I made of the web players, and the sound was really out of sync after I made the YouTube upload, but hopefully that’s one of those postprocessing things…
