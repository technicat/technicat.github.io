While watching Freaks and Geeks on DVD recently, all the&nbsp;references to drinking “pop” brought back a bit of nostalgia for the Midwest. I just say “soda” now, or more often, specifically a Coke, Pepsi, or occasionally a Jarritos. I wish, just once, I’d ordered a “tonic” in Boston, but never tried it. If you want to order carbonated beverages in a knowledgable manner around the country and around the world, check the [Wikipedia article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Names_for_soft_drinks).

Coincidentally, I just found this can of Pepsi that I left in the freezer - it puts the “pop” in pop.
