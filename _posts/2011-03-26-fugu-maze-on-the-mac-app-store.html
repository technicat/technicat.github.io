<p>Perhaps simpler is better. <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=426993175&amp;mt=12">Fugu Maze</a> just got approved on the Mac App Store after about a week in the queue and a day or so of preparation (I hadn&rsquo;t touched the non-iOS version for at least a year, so it required some dusting off). Meanwhile, <a href="http://hyperbowl3d.com/">HyperBowl</a> has been rejected three times, after submitting it six weeks ago, and after two months of preparation. Ah, well, maybe fourth time&rsquo;s the charm.</p>
