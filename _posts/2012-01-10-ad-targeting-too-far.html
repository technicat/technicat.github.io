<p>Abstractly, I know that ad targeting is going on and don&rsquo;t really think about it, but once in a while it can get creepy. Take this Facebook ad - &ldquo;Men LOVE This GAME !&rdquo; (and what&rsquo;s with the capitalization? Some people should have their shift keys removed). Could have been worse - based on my profile, it could have said &ldquo;45-year old Men in Huntington Beach LOVE This GAME!&rdquo;</p>
