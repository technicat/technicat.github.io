<p>After my second accidental 911 call from my aging Blackberry Pearl (the screen lock menu has three buttons, one of which is 911), I decided it was time to upgrade. T-Mobile finally has a good-looking Android phone in the Samsung Galaxy Vibrant, so I bit the bullet (meaning I plopped down a credit card and watched $300 print out on a receipt), but now I&rsquo;m experiencing some buyer&rsquo;s remorse.</p>

<p>First of all, an $18 &ldquo;upgrade&rdquo; fee? After locking me into another two-year contract? Talk about nickel-and-diming. And I hate rebates. Just give me the $50 discount immediately instead of making me go online to fill out a form only to find out that I have to print it out and mail it in, anyway. Telcoms aren&rsquo;t great at web design, so I could have filled out the original paper rebate form in a fraction of the time. I guess I have to mail in the form because they really want me to cut up the cardboard on the box that includes the serial number and try to cram it into an envelope.</p>

<p>Then there&rsquo;s the phone. It worked immediately&hellip;as a phone. None of the Internet stuff worked for hours, until I figured out they hadn&rsquo;t activated my data plan (I had to upgrade it to a more expensive version from my previous plan, for some reason), although my online account showed my the plan as active. Once the data plan was functioning, I got email working after laboriously filling out all the fields for each of my accounts - their &ldquo;automatic&rdquo; email activation doesn&rsquo;t work as well as on the Blackberry. It&rsquo;s great the Vibrant has a wifi option, but some services require that it be disabled, so it&rsquo;s more convenient just to leave it off. I can&rsquo;t seem to prevent Google Talk from constantly attempting to log in, so there&rsquo;s a pesky red exclamation mark always on display on top of the screen. </p>

<p>And most dishearteningly, I can&rsquo;t seem to download any apps from the Android Market. They just get stuck in a &ldquo;starting download&rdquo; phase. I found two threads discussing the issue on the Android support site - the first thread started a year ago and was closed due to volume. The second thread was marked as resolved this summer, but without explaining the resolution, and the thread is continuing, including complaints from app developers who have to deal with customers giving bad ratings and asking for refunds. This is giving pause to my Android development plans (along with reports that the Galaxy is crashing Unity without an Android 2.2 upgrade). One more fix I&rsquo;m trying is to create a new gmail account instead of  the google account I supplied for login (it&rsquo;s a very Borg-like setup), but right now the captcha in the gmail setup is rejecting everything I type. (it should be called rejectcha)</p>

<p>On the plus side, the Vibrant has a great looking AMOLED screen with a resolution a bit smaller than an iPhone 4 and CPU speed to match, the box looks good, it looks enough like the iPhone that you can pretend it is one, and it comes with Avatar and The Sims 3, so I can watch and play those, respectively, for the next two years. And then maybe I&rsquo;ll switch back to the Blackberry, if RIM has got its act together by then, or to a real iPhone, if Apple has stopped dating AT&amp;T exclusively by then.</p>
