<p>I killed a day playing around with <a href="http://dopresskit.com/">presskit()</a>, a free press kit web template. I created a page for <a href="http://presskit.hyperbowl3d.com/">HyperBowl</a>, and I think it looks alright. The installation is pretty easy - download the zip file, unzip to get just one file, install.php, which you upload to a web site (that supports PHP of course), visit that page on the site and follow the instructions, which mostly involve click-to-continue and uploading banner and (optionally) logo and icon images along with any number of other images, and editing then renaming the generated data.xml file with your press kit contents.</p>

<p>There are a couple of quirks. Extra images don&rsquo;t display completely unless you can get just the right aspect ratio, and I don&rsquo;t see a way to remove the Projects header. And the optional Projects are essentially other presskit() pages in a subdirectory. It would be nice to have them on other web sites, so I could have one for each project and a master one on my company site.</p>

<p>But still, it&rsquo;s better than something I would have put together from scratch, and I&rsquo;m tempted to see if I can use it for a resume.</p>
