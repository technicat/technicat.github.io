<p>I&rsquo;m a regular at the discount store at the corner by my place (so much so that a neighbor recently asked if I work there), but there&rsquo;s a reason that stuff is so cheap. The $1 flip flops? Broke after a week. The $10 bathroom scale? Never worked.</p>

<p>So I went the other extreme and picked up the Withings smart scale at the Apple Store for $150. Which means I&rsquo;ll be weighing myself constantly just to get my money&rsquo;s worth. But it&rsquo;s pretty cool. You set it up via a bluetooth connection with an iOS device that has their app installed, and after that every time you step on the scale your stats are uploaded over wifi and they show up on your iOS or Android device:</p>
