<p>Well, I don&rsquo;t know if this is something that&rsquo;s changed, but I thought that selecting a Camera in the Unity Editor would display its frustum, but here, it didn&rsquo;t:</p>

<p><a href="http://itshardtofondlepenguins.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Screen-shot-2012-06-12-at-12.19.17-AM.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5578" title="Screen shot 2012-06-12 at 12.19.17 AM" src="http://itshardtofondlepenguins.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Screen-shot-2012-06-12-at-12.19.17-AM.png" alt="" width="772" height="607"/></a></p>

<p>Then I realized it would show up, along with the camera preview, if I opened the Camera component of the camera object.</p>

<p>So, good tip to remember.</p>
