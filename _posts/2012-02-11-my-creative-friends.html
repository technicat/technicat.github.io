<p>I&rsquo;ve been getting irritated by the use of &ldquo;creative&rdquo; as a label for people, ever since I used to read all those references to the &ldquo;creative class&rdquo;. It was a great way to sell Macs to people who like to think they&rsquo;re in the creative class. Like cigarette ads targeted to women, saying &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve come a long way, baby.&quot;  But what&rsquo;s with this &quot;class&rdquo; business. Is this England? Do you guys want butlers? It&rsquo;s very hoighty-toighty and elitist.</p>

<p>Maybe others agree. More recently, I&rsquo;ve seen the term &ldquo;creatives&rdquo; used. Just today, I read an article that had that term in every paragraph. But it still bugs me. Are you saying everyone else is not creative? If scientists started calling themselves the &ldquo;smart class&rdquo; or &ldquo;the thinking people&rdquo;, I don&rsquo;t think that would go over well (although there is &ldquo;intelligentsia&rdquo;).</p>

<p>And who qualifies as creative? I&rsquo;m sure everyone on the Think Different billboards would make the cut, but what about, say, John Grisham? Maybe you&rsquo;d say blue-collar workers don&rsquo;t make the grade, but one of my plumbers created a web video series showcasing debates on themes like who&rsquo;s a bigger badass, Spiderman or Han Solo (just the concept seems pretty creative to me), and the guy who installed my shower door is a musician (shower doors pay better). In this age of YouTube, where anyone can create and professionals come up with stuff like Jersey Shore, it&rsquo;s just not a useful category.</p>

<p>OK, I have to admit I am enthralled by the talents of my friends who are musicians and artists, and naturally I refer to them as creative. So I guess it&rsquo;s like the term &ldquo;visionary&rdquo; - it&rsquo;s fine to use it to describe others (as long as you don&rsquo;t overdo it), but it&rsquo;s pretty obnoxious if you use it to describe yourself (and I have seen &ldquo;visionary&rdquo; on a resume - I wonder if it&rsquo;s on the guy&rsquo;s business card, like Wile E. Coyote, Super Genius).</p>

<p>But really what dazzles me is the combination of talent and skill in an area that seems beyond me. I&rsquo;m also amazed by people who are fluent in multiple languages and comfortable with advanced math and theoretical physics. I admire a lot of a lot of programmers, but I consider myself a pretty good programmer, and I have favorite writers, but based on the scant evidence of a short story course I took over twenty years ago, I could conceive of myself writing. On the other hand, I took years of piano lessons but I can&rsquo;t imagine myself performing, improvising, composing, or even singing on key. That is still like magic to me. So I&rsquo;ll wrap this up with a video of a couple of my music friends doing their stuff:</p>
