<p>I had a long-standing policy of not writing any reviews on the App Store. Actually, it wasn&rsquo;t so much a policy as I didn&rsquo;t feel like it. But I figure if I want people to review my apps, I should be principled about it and make an effort to do the same. I&rsquo;m taking the high road, or the high-rating road, and avoiding writing snarky reviews about free apps, but that&rsquo;s not entirely due to a sense of honor - it&rsquo;s just easier to review apps that are good enough to keep on my device and spend time with.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t exactly have a formula, but I reserve one-star for apps that crash immediately or too often, anything that runs reliably gets at least two stars, anything moderately useful or entertaining get three stars, and if it&rsquo;s something I use regularly, it gets four or five stars. Being a great value (i.e. free or cheap) might add a star. I can&rsquo;t think of a better way to factor price/value. It&rsquo;s be nice if there were different rating categories. Also, too bad there&rsquo;s no web link to a particular user&rsquo;s reviews (that I know of - to find all mine, I have to find a review I wrote and click on my username). And too bad the the listing of my App Store and Mac App Store reviews are separate (but I guess that goes back to the previous point).</p>

<p>Anyway, not exactly NYT Book Review quality here, but at least now you can see a list of my favorite apps!</p>
