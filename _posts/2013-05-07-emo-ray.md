I just discovered the Emo-Ray game I worked on at Heavy Water over a year ago has been ovailable on Playstation@Home for a few months, now. Nice to see they included my name on the credit list displayed in the public area for the game (five programmers, total). At first, I didn’t remember doing much on the game - I worked there part time for three months on at least four different projects - but looking at the video, yeah, I did some HUD work (if there’s any constant theme in my contract work, it’s HUD), multiple camera support, FMV player…of course, there’s probably been a lot of code rewriting since then. But who knows, I’ve had former coworkers tell me they haven’t changed my code in the years since I’ve left (I don’t know if that’s a good or bad thing).
