<p>The most-played game on my iPod touch is&hellip;Scrabble. It&rsquo;s got a lot going for it: a polished look (e.g. the nice animated screen while it&rsquo;s loading, although I don&rsquo;t understand why the load time is so long), the original game is fun (I played against the computer three times on the day I bought the app), but what makes it a near-daily play for me is the Facebook connection - I play regularly against one of my high school classmates.</p>

<p>At $2.99, it&rsquo;s reasonably priced. But the iPad version is $9.99, which is why it&rsquo;s not going to qualify as the most-played game on my iPad.</p>
