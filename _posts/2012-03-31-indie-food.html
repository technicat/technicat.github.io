<p>I often hear about how startup founders hunker down in an apartment and live on ramen for several months (particularly if they&rsquo;re operating on Y-Combinator funding). I assume by ramen they mean the tasteless paste you can get four for a dollar at the supermarket. So I&rsquo;m thinking the next startup hotbeds should really spawn around Asian population centers. Here, for example, in Orange County&rsquo;s Little Saigon, a recent grocery run netted me a much higher quality instant noodle, microwaveable fried rice, and a guilty pleasure, shrimp-flavored chips, with each item costing a little over a dollar. I don&rsquo;t recommend the Fortuna luncheon meat, though - the original Spam is the gold standard.</p>
