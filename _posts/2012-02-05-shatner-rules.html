<p>I saw William Shatner give a talk at MIT back in the eighties. I recalls his enthusiasm, relating stories that surely were embellished, one of which featured some instinctual martial arts prowess that he miraculously summoned, along with a complete misunderstanding of physics (he cited the opposite of one of Newton&rsquo;s Laws). The crowd loved him.</p>

<p>His latest memoir, <b>Shatner Rules: Your Guide to Understanding the Shatnerverse and the World at Large</b> is similar, but it&rsquo;s not all ham. Spanning the ups and downs of his adult life (not much about his childhood, but you get the impression that he didn&rsquo;t get the attention he needed), he gets serious about his first wife&rsquo;s addiction and accidental death, rough treatment by tabloids, low points of his career (living out of a car), and his ambivalence about being Kirk (interestingly resolved after meeting Patrick Stewart, who took his Jean-Luc Picard role very seriously). Despite the self-deprecating bits of his narration, Shatner is obviously sensitive to the criticism of his acting and hostility by many of his Enterprise crewmates. And who wouldn&rsquo;t be? But really, he should have watched a couple of Comedy Central roasts before agreeing to be the target of one, and if a lot of people who worked with you don&rsquo;t like you, saying they&rsquo;re just jealous and what did I do? isn&rsquo;t very convincing.</p>

<p>It seems to me his humor is slightly homophobic, and slightly more anti-geek (hey, if you don&rsquo;t like what the critics are saying, remember your fans and stop telling them to get a life). And hardly any mention of Third Rock from the Sun? But the guy is working hard and having fun, and it&rsquo;s hard to hold anything against him. He may not be a geek, or everyman (he seems to think being broke as an actor is worse than any of us being broke), but he is Kirk.</p>
