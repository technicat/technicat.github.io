<p>This may not be smart business strategy or use of time, but once I have an app on the App Store, it&rsquo;s staying there, and if it&rsquo;s there, I feel obligated to update it. (and even if Apple rejects it, I&rsquo;m putting it on Android).</p>

<p>So I finally dusted off <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/fugutilt/id295241739">Fugu Tilt</a> and added some new eye candy to it - water, skyboxes and lens flares. And ads (if you stay in my house, you help pay the bills!)</p>

<p>Same for <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/app/fugu-type/id361179164">Fugu Type</a> - new water, but not the ads. In truth, I would like to put in ads and make it free, but the keyboard takes up so much screen space on the iPhone that ads would obscure too much of the remainder. But maybe I&rsquo;ll try it - you never know til you try.</p>
