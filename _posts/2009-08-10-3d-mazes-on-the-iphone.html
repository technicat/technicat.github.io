<p>I did a search on the App Store for maze games, recently, and got lots and lots of results. But I&rsquo;m really just interested in 3D mazes, for comparison to my own app. I&rsquo;m sure this is not a complete set, but here&rsquo;s a roundup of the ones I know about.</p>

<p>This is the first one I found and installed last year. It&rsquo;s called, appropriately, Maze3D. With it&rsquo;s wireframe rendering, it reminds me of an old Apple II game (Wizardry?) that made a huge impression on me on the possibilities of 3D computer graphics. It&rsquo;s free, so nothing to complain about.</p>

<p>The next three apps use the Unity engine and thus feature richer graphics (although still constrained by the iPhone hardware limitations). FuguMaze is my entry into this niche. It&rsquo;s a port of my Mac widget and is really more an attempt to produce an atmospheric experience than any kind of competitive or scoring game, which is why I&rsquo;ve avoided adding timers or objectives like the other mazes (despite numerous comments on the App Store reviews - I&rsquo;m sticking to my guns. For now).</p>

<p>FuguMaze was, to my surprise, my most popular widget, and same goes for the app, which received 20,000 downloads in its first week. So I started charging $.99 for it and the downloads went way down. But that&rsquo;s another story. </p>

Labyrinth 3D was the next Unity maze to show up and featured flying navigation, using the tilt control, rather than a first-person character view. Also priced at $.99 if I recall.</p>

<p>RealMaze 3D is a really 3D maze, i.e. you can move among levels via ladders. It addresses some issues I had with FuguMaze: better performance by minimizing triangles per wall (I&rsquo;ve avoided doing that because I don&rsquo;t want to lose the spotlights) and a nice tutorial. Fortunately for me, this app is priced just a bit higher, $1.99.</p>

<p>And finally, MazeShifter is the most recent Unity-based maze, featuring an objective (I think it involves finding an object) and a map. Also in one of the lower pricing tiers, either $.99 or $1.99.</p>
