<p>Christmas came early for me this year. After getting my first new car in nineteen years, I&rsquo;m still figuring out all the new technology features. My previous car didn&rsquo;t even have power locks or windows. Or quite as much plastic. The most fun new feature for me is the iPod connection. Here I&rsquo;m playing the Concrete Scrapbook album from my friend Michelle Krell (available on iTunes - support your indie musician!)</p>
