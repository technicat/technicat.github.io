<p>I&rsquo;m trying out yet another Android appstore, this one for the<a href="http://nabitablet.com/"> Nabi tablet</a> (the folks at Zeemote pointed me to it). <a href="http://hyperbowl3d.com/">HyperBowl</a> is now there, so let&rsquo;s see how that goes. Once again, this <a href="http://fuguhapps.com/">appstore</a> is fairly new so not ridiculously crowded, but there are some corresponding glitches in getting apps on there, too (e.g. it keeps complaining about a missing version code when I try uploading Fugu Maze, which is baffling). In fact, the software looks like it&rsquo;s been repurpuposed from some other phone app storefront, since it requires you to load screenshots that are not only lower-res, but different aspect ratios from the Nabi! The device itself is really nice, though - a modern Tegra3 tablet for $200, and they did a nice job on the on the interface. Actually, two interfaces, the kids&rsquo; mode and the mommy/daddy mode. Now, we&rsquo;ll just have to see if people will buy apps on it (or if I can figure out how to ads properly on a kid device, or, shudder!, actually get around to implementing in-app purchases).</p>
