<p>It&rsquo;s time for me to pay my royalty fees for the HyperBowl license. That&rsquo;s a bit of a hassle, with all the apps on all the app stores, but App Annie makes the process somewhat less painful, at least for the App Store, Google Play and the Amazon Appstore. In each of those cases, instead of poring over CSV files, I can just take a look at the App Annie revenue summary. One tip: to set the date range, select the end date first, then the start date. It&rsquo;s not obvious.</p>
