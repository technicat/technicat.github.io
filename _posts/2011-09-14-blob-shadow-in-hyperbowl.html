<p>Unity doesn&rsquo;t support real shadows on mobile devices (by real, I mean shadows dynamically computed from the shadowing geometry), but you can project shadow textures onto surfaces using the Projector component. In fact, Unity includes a blob shadow prefab. Which reminds me of the time I worked on replacing the blob shadows in a skateboarding game with detailed shadows via shadow maps, only to have the game director decide the blob shadows looked better (hey, that was my job, to give him a choice!)</p>

<p>Anyway, that is one feature from the original <a href="http://hyperbowl3d.com/">HyperBowl</a> that is missing in the new version for iOS, and I&rsquo;m rectifying that by now by adding a blob ball shadow for HyperBowl on the iPad2 (on other devices, I&rsquo;m on the edge with the frame rate for the bigger levels). That is one of the remaining user complaints I have to address - there has been only one, but that guy actually emailed me and left two strident reviews on the App Store. I hope he has an iPad2.</p>
