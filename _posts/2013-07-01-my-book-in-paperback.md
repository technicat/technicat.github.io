I got a nice present the other day on my doorstep (usually it’s just some kind of animal poop), this time a box of my [Unity book](http://learnunity4.com/), courtesy of Apress.

I think the [kindle version](http://www.amazon.com/Learn-Unity-Game-Development-ebook/dp/B00ACC6BJK/ref=dp_kinw_strp_1)&nbsp;turned out better (color graphics and web links), although maybe the code listings are easier to read on the bigger printed page, but anyway it’s always nice to see a real book on a shelf. My friends at [La Petite Baguette](http://lapetitebaguette.com/) kindly put a copy on display, right next their French cookbooks!
