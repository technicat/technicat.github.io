<p>While morbidly googling for old employers (I&rsquo;m afraid I&rsquo;ve left a trail of moribund companies in my wake), I ran across this <a href="http://jobs-salary.com/">jobs salary site</a>. Better than using salary surveys, these are real salary records obtained from the Department of Labor. I found my last employer (oh, so many years ago) was as cheap as I thought, but here&rsquo;s how the other half lives - some snippets, from Goldman Sachs, and Google (maybe I should try applying again).
