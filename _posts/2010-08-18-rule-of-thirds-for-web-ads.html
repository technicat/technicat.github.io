<p>I have a rule of thirds when it comes to web ads (along with a rule of popups and a rule of flashing banner ads)  - I am not inclined to tweet/share/inflict a web page on others if two thirds of the page doesn&rsquo;t consist of content. Like this Forbes page, which has a story surrounded by blocks of large type blaring at you to sign up for other Forbes products.</p>

<p>You could argue that ads promoting other Forbes products or promotions or tie-ins qualify as Forbes content (at least on my own web site, that&rsquo;s the story I&rsquo;m sticking with). But the reason I got peeved is at the bottom of the page, where it&rsquo;s clear the entire story might have fit on this page if they&rsquo;d given it, say, maybe 40% of the page.</p>

<p>To be fair, I&rsquo;ve seen a lot worse. Indeed, I&rsquo;ve followed twitter links to articles which just had one or a  few sentences, surrounded by a sea of ads, requiring you to click on a  link to read more of the story. Eventually, they&rsquo;ll just feed us a word  at a time.</p>
