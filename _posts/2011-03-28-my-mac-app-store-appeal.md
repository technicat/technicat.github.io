Well, I got my fourth [HyperBowl](http://hyperbowl3d.com/) rejection on the Mac App Store today, which I hear isn’t unusual, if you’re going through the final TRC (technical requirements checklist) with Nintendo. But that’s Nintendo, with some fairly sharp cookies doing the review (some of them have edited the Game Gems series, including one, Steve Rabin, who answered the phone when I agitatedly wanted to know what was wrong with my GameCube submission), fairly precise requirements, and, reassuringly, game concept preapproval before you get that far. For the Mac App Store, in contrast, I assume as on the iOS App Store there is an army of reviewers, and accordingly some frustratingly vague and read-between-the-lines feedback (“can you tell me exactly which trademark I’m infringing?”) And Apple has never had much of a game mindset with the Mac (they seem much more gung-ho about making iOS a gaming platform), so perhaps this is what I should have expected. In any case, I’m at the point where I’m just chopping away at the game, amputating a feature here and there, hoping to get it accepted and I’m ready to give up and just concentrate on the [iOS version](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/hyperbowl/id344209253?mt=8) (the iPad2 should run all the original HyperBowl content - who needs a Mac/PC?) Still, I didn’t feel right about giving up without exercising the appeal option (I’ll have to try using one of my two provided technical support calls one of these days), so I clicked that link and submitted the following appeal. In the range between obsequiessness and ranting, it probably leans toward the latter, but hey, even though they say you can’t fight city hall, once in a while you should put up a feeble protest, before saying “thank you, may I have another”. And I did pay $99 (I have to put up with complaints from people who paid $.99 for an app) I am a little concerned that the link the to appeal page was broken (a little editing of the URL fixes it) and the resulting confirmation email says “iOS” instead of “Mac App”, so I wonder how many people bother to appeal.

> HyperBowl has been rejected four times now, and frankly I don’t agree with any of the reasons, except possibly one bug that I haven’t reproduced (and even in that case, if it didn’t stop gameplay, I don’t think it should have been a cause for rejection). In the first case, the reviewer didn’t realize you had to click the flashing red buttons to move past the menu screen. I made a point of using the red buttons to navigate all the front end screens, including the logo screen that precedes the menu screen, to make that clear and consistent, and it has not been a problem with the webplayer and iOS versions (or the original arcade version that I ported from, and the desire to keep the feel of the arcade version is a big reason I kept those buttons). Nevertheless, I removed all the front end menu screens, thereby also removing multiplayer mode, to surmount that objection. I also received these comments: “The app appears to be a mostly unmodified port of an iOS app” which is technically incorrect of course (it has to be modified to run at all, there are mouse controls instead of touch controls, it’s running in a window instead of fullscreen, it’s running on top of a background image…) and historically incorrect since the iOS app is a port of the webplayer version that I published first, which is in turn a port of the original arcade and Windows version, and “The Mac OS environment significantly different from the iOS environment, and it is important that your app be a great app on Mac OS X. Multiple windows, windows that resize or go full screen, and control functionality for mouse and keyboard, are some of the many features customers expect in a Mac OS X app, and it’s important that your app look and work well in a Mac OS X environment.” which is also general enough to be unclear about the precise objection and also sounds more applicable to a word processing app than a game (e.g. it’s a rare polished game that will allow you arbitrarily resize the window and thus the aspect ratio. And multiple windows?) These last two comments were repeated in the last rejection, after I removed the fullscreen mode to get around the reported bug that apparently occurs when switching from fullscreen to windowed mode under certain circumstances, along with the more specific suggestion to put fullscreen mode back in (doesn’t fullscreen mode actually make it resemble the iOS version more?). I’m guessing from the “windows that resize or go fullscreen” phrase that enabling some alternate windows resolutions (that retain the desired aspect ratio 4:3) might also address this rejection, but that’s just guessing and at this point I don’t want to waste any more time on submitting if I’m just going to again receive comments about how my game looks too much like the iOS version and the high expectations of MacOSX users and how “less than very good” may be rejected, which frankly is getting on my nerves and smacks of snobbery, especially if you’re going to allow people to price free or at $.99. And I feel I’m actually removing features and making my product worse as I jump through hoops, which is what typically happens in the game business when working through publishers. This is what I and I imagine many others hoped to avoid with the Mac App Store (the appeal “self-publishing”). My much, much simpler Fugu Maze app was approved on the Mac App Store with much less trouble, which indicates to me that is the way to go, and submitting any game with any complexity is not a good use of time. I have few issues with my game submissions to the iOS App Store (there, I have more disagreements about the rejection criteria for some non-game apps), but on the Mac App Store, I urge you to consider how you review games and phrase the rejection criteria appropriately and precisely so it doesn’t look like a bureaucratic cut-and-paste job with resulting guessing game. Also, by the way, the link to the appeal page that’s included with each of the rejections appears to be malformed, requires a little editing to get it to work.
