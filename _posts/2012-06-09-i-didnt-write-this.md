In theory I don’t mind working with experienced editors. In practice, I feel like people messed up my text, sometimes to the point where it’s terrible and I worry people think I write that badly. Look at the product description for my Elektra Dance app on the Amazon Appstore:

The bulleted list is not bad, though “3D-like” is a weird term. The summary below is painful to read - it doesn’t exactly have the snap of ad copy, nor the flow of experienced writing. Instead, it appears to be a tediously spelled-out explanation of technical concepts as recently learned from wikipedia. So who writes this stuff? I don’t know, but all I can say is, I didn’t write it.
