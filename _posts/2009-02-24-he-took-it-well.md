At the end of last week’s Lost episode, when the airline captain played by [Jeff Fahey](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Fahey) realized who was on his plane and calmly stated, “We’re not going to Guam, are we?”, I couldn’t help but think, he took that well.

I don’t like to use that phrase, even in my head, ever since I had a boss who liked to take employees into her office, note their personality and performance defects, then remark later “he took that well”, or “she took that well”. I guess that’s how you characterize suppressed burning resentment. Anyway, I always thought that was an odd thing to say in that context. Do muggers say, after a mugging, “he took that well?” Or after a mixed martial arts fight, I’ve never heard the winner comment in his post-victory interview, “he took that beating well”, or “he took that kick to the head well”. I could see one context where it’s appropriate - Animal House style fraternity hazing. Thank you, may I have another!
