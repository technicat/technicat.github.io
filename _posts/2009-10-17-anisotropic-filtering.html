<p>Darn, I realized after updating the <a href="http://www.apple.com/downloads/dashboard/games/hyperbowlclassic.html">HyperBowl Classic widget</a> that my latest reimport of the assets clobbered the texture <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anisotropic_filtering">anisotropic filtering</a> settings, which improves the appearance of textures viewed at sharp angles (instead of head-on). It makes a big difference - I fixed it in the <a href="http://hyperbowl3d.com/">web player</a>, so you can see the difference between the two. Here&rsquo;s the web player:</p>

<p><a href="http://hyperbowl3d.com/"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2710" title="Picture 13" src="http://itshardtofondlepenguins.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/Picture-13.png" alt="Picture 13" width="442" height="582"/></a></p>

<p>The rings look pretty smooth, eh? Now take a look at the the widget:</p>

<p><a href="//www.apple.com/downloads/dashboard/games/hyperbowlclassic.html"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2711" title="Picture 14" src="http://itshardtofondlepenguins.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/Picture-14.png" alt="Picture 14" width="320" height="489"/></a></p>

<p>Notice there&rsquo;s more blurring and blotchiness in the wood texture of the rings, and it&rsquo;s even more distracting when you see it in motion, giving a rippling effect (oh, well, next update&hellip;) The iPhone apparently doesn&rsquo;t support anisotropic filtering (or at least not much), so this artifact is also visible in the <a href="http://itunes.com/app/hyperbowlclassic">iPhone version</a>.</p>
