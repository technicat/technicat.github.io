A while back, Goodreads changed their Terms of Service to include one of those all-encompassing indemnification clauses that I detest. When I complained about it on one of the Goodreads groups, a member asked me to explain the issue “in layman’s terms”. Now, that’s a problem if web site users are implicitly agreeing to a contract without the ability to understand it.

Some sites don’t have this broad indemnification clause, e.g. Twitter, Facebook and last I checked, TripAdvisor (this clause is particularly disquieting on a site that relies on user-written reviews, so it’s disappointing that Goodreads has it - what if someone sues Goodreads because they don’t like a book review you wrote? Don’t laugh - it happens on Tripadvisor)

It’s hard to avoid using Google, though, which uses this clause on everything including YouTube. So I was hoping that Vimeo had something better, especially since I just noticed that Vimeo now works on the iPhone and iPad.
