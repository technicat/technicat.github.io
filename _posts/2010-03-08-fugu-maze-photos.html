<p>I&rsquo;ve been unable to google the source of the recent upturn in <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=295808255&amp;mt=8">Fugu Maze</a> sales on the App Store - the most I can tell from my AppViz report is that it might be taking place in Great Britain. And since it has taken place since the most recent app update, I&rsquo;m going to guess that part of the popularity is due to the photo picker feature (if that&rsquo;s true, then the Unity iPhone Enhancement Pack has already paid for itself!)</p>

<p>Customizing a maze with your own &ldquo;wall photo&rdquo; may be more fun to some than actually solving the maze. Here are some screenshots of my tests, using an old college photo, a picture of my cat, and a baby picture of my nephew.</p>
