I’m using a $100 promotional Google Adsense credit to advertise HyperBowl (at $2/day). It seems to be working, to the extent that searching for “hyperbowl” brings up the ad above all the results. (although on my iPad, the ad shows up on the right).

But my HyperBowl site, which is the site that the ad links to, shows up as the top search result, anyway. So I’m not sure what I just accomplished, except to give the impression that I have an advertising strategy (and budget).
