WordsEye Feature has been on the [App Store](http://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=305827351&mt=8) for a while, but I finally got around to knocking out a [Mac widget](http://www.apple.com/downloads/dashboard/justforfun/wordseyefeature.html). It’s also running as a web player on [Fugu Games](http://www.fugugames.com/)- here it is (click on it to proceed to the next image):
