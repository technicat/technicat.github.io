After trying out [ComicCMS](http://comiccms.com/) with just my WordsEye images on [http://itshardtofondlepenguins.com/](http://itshardtofondlepenguins.com/) I decided to try it with Unity. I just followed the ComicCMS manual instructions on adding support for swf files, but adding “unity3d” to the file types instead, and adding object/embed code for Unity instead of Flash. I didn’t have any luck with the Unity 3.x javascript embedding, so I just copied and tweaked the Unity 2.x code I still have on my Fugu Games site. It doesn’t seem to work with IE for some reason, but who cares, it’s IE. The result is on [http://whimsy3d.com/](http://whimsy3d.com/)
