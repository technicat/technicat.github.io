<p>I worked my way halfway through Richard Dawkins&rsquo; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ancestor%27s_Tale">The Ancestor&rsquo;s Tale</a> and found it an entertaining read until I ran into his footnote complaining about the &ldquo;pompous meddling&rdquo; in the English language that brought us revisions such as &ldquo;Beijing&rdquo;, &ldquo;Mumbai&rdquo; and &ldquo;cosmonaut&rdquo;.Â  This is a pretty weird gripe from someone who seems to take an amused view of heated taxonomic nomenclature debates, but it&rsquo;s not the first time I&rsquo;ve heard a Briton get his hackles up over the demise of &ldquo;Bombay&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Now, first of all, it&rsquo;s actually pronounced &ldquo;Mumbai&rdquo;, or at least a whole lot closer, by Indians, as &ldquo;Beijing&rdquo; is just about right, compared to &ldquo;Peking&rdquo;. That&rsquo;s a good thing - I&rsquo;m sure if foreigners in London insisted on calling the city something like &ldquo;lantern&rdquo; or &ldquo;lowdown&rdquo; and said &ldquo;hey, don&rsquo;t mess with our language&rdquo; when corrected, that wouldn&rsquo;t sit well with the locals. Second, making up a spelling based on a lousy pronunciation because you couldn&rsquo;t be bothered to learn the original correctly and then expecting the world to use your new mispronunciation - that constitutes lazy work and &ldquo;pompous meddling&rdquo;.</p>

<p>The new spellings aren&rsquo;t just better as a matter of political correctness. I still say &ldquo;Peking duck&rdquo; because that&rsquo;s the way it&rsquo;s spelled, but I say &ldquo;Beijing&rdquo; because that&rsquo;s the way it&rsquo;s spelled (now) and so now I&rsquo;m actually the latter more or less correctly. And by correctly, I mean when I say it to someone who&rsquo;s Chinese they&rsquo;ll know what city I&rsquo;m talking about (this could be handy if I ever visit China). I still wince when I say &ldquo;dim sum&rdquo; to someone who&rsquo;s Chinese, because I know it&rsquo;s pronounced more like &ldquo;deem sum&rdquo; but for some reason I feel compelled to say it the way I visualize it spelled. On the other hand &ldquo;deem sum&rdquo; is actually Cantonese, the language of Hong Kong which is famed for dim sum. The Mandarin for dim sum is &ldquo;dian xin&rdquo; and if I had to start saying that, it would sound even more wrong to me, since I grew up listening to Cantonese (Which reminds me, I had a British coworker who, when I mentioned my parents grew up in Hong Kong, responded how &ldquo;we civilized that place&rdquo;. You know, the empire is over. Get used to it and move on. And by the way, Hong Kong is actually more like &ldquo;Herng Gong&rdquo; in Cantonese, so thanks for mangling that, too).</p>

<p>Anyway, there are plenty of English language misuses that bother me more than how foreign capitols are spelled (or is it capital? Now I&rsquo;m doing it) Like principle instead of principal (saw that in a recent Gamasutra news article) Or irregardless instead of regardless (bunch of white guys on C-Span2 complaining about the illiteracy of illegal immigrants) Or misnomer used for misconception (by sports commentators, along with bountiful employment of &ldquo;thus far&rdquo;).</p>

<p>Irregardless of any misnomers encountered thus far as a matter of principal. Back to the British. It really bothers me to hear object-oriented programming termed &ldquo;object-orientated&rdquo; programming (object-oriented programming has come under enough attack lately). And aluminum pronounced &ldquo;aluminium&rdquo;. <a href="http://www.worldwidewords.org/index.htm">World Wide Worlds</a>, an informative site about &ldquo;international English from a British viewpoint&rdquo;, explains how terms like &ldquo;orientated&rdquo; and &ldquo;aluminium&rdquo; diverged from and in some cases predate the American English equivalents and how both variations are legitimate depending on context (or location). But I don&rsquo;t care how legitimate it is, I&rsquo;ll just call that pompous meddling.</p>
