It was nice to see today in my Gamasutra RSS feed no mention of a lawsuit. Besides other ramifications, I wonder if any companies consider that a reputation for suing makes them less attractive as employers? At least, speaking for myself, one of my career goals is to get through it without ending up in court. (I mean, what’s the point of citing work responsibilities to get out of jury duty if work is just going to put you back in?)

You’d think that would be an easily attainable goal, but I’ve noticed after joining the game industry that I’ve cut it pretty close. One of my employers often talked about suing employees and did sue two consecutive publishers after I left. A publisher client of mine ended up in a lawsuit over a game they hired me to evaluate (again, good timing, after I left). After I wrapped up a PC version of a product for a developer client, a colleague there inquired whether I’d be interested in testifying on their behalf in a lawsuit over the console version of the game (I regrettably declined).

And sometimes moral indignation does come into play. A while back EA had contacted me a couple of times and I told them I wanted to stay freelance, but really, I should have told them I wasn’t too pleased when they sued a couple of my friends who’d left EALA with a bunch of others en masse to start another company, and then once the suit had been settled and supposedly under a don’t-talk-about-it-rule, had their corporate counsel crow on gamasutra in a manner implicating guilt. If that’s the way you treat employees, you’d better pay a lot.

Of course, lawsuits are just a tool of the big business world (although it seems to me politicians citing the need for tort reform are just concerned with individuals suing companies). I read an interview of Adobe’s CEO in which he recounted how he got annoyed with Macromedia’s success with Flash and instructed his legal minions to dig up some patents they could use as grounds for a lawsuit. And then over a friendly lunch with his counterpart they decided on a merger. I guess it’s just a game to them. But it’s not a game I want to play.
