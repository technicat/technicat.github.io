The good folks at the [Westminster Veterinary Group](http://www.westminsterveterinarygroup.com/) have taken to my cat Jiggs, so much so that they tend to call me “Mister Jiggs” on the phone. I’ve considered changing my name to save trouble, but I settled instead for registering the domain name, [http://www.misterjiggs.com/](http://www.misterjiggs.com/) Not much there except a few cat photos sure to bore anyone who’s not into cats, or my cat in particular.

I remember in one of my previous jobs another cat owner and I would start talking loudly about our cats whenever our coworkers started going on about their kids. I don’t know what you’d do in that situation if you aren’t a pet-owner or parent - find some World of Warcraft players I suppose and go on about that.

In any case, I’ll close by inflicting a cat video of Mister Jiggs (actually, she should be called Miss Jiggs):
