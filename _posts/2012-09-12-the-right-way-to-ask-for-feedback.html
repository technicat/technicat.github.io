<p>I get a lot of email asking me to fill out a survey. I never do - it&rsquo;s like saying, &ldquo;Thanks for being our customer, would you mind filling out a bunch of forms?&rdquo;</p>

<p>This email I received from Dark Horse yesterday is the right way to do it. Just give us some feedback in a manner that&rsquo;s convenient for you, and here&rsquo;s a token of our appreciation. Now, that token is more a coupon than a prize, and it&rsquo;s only redeemable on their web store, whereas I prefer to read comics on my iPad, but I&rsquo;ll save a discussion on why they have two or three different digital stores for another day. In the meantime, even though I probably won&rsquo;t use the coupon, I&rsquo;ll try to remember to leave a review for their iOS app.</p>
