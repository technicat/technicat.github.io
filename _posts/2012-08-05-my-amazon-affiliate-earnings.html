<p>I&rsquo;ve been thinking about dropping the Amazon affiliate program, because it might compromise my journalistic integrity, and I&rsquo;ve made only $1.70 from it. Also, it&rsquo;s a pain adding the affiliate links and that affiliate notice (which you&rsquo;re supposed to put on your web page and no one seems to do that) takes up some real estate. But you know what, it&rsquo;s kind of interesting to see what people buy. Here&rsquo;s where I made my buck and change commission.</p>
