<p>Ordinarily, I prefer to conduct my business on a web site whenever I can, but sometimes, web sites just suck. And usually that&rsquo;s a portent of the customer service to follow, as when I sent feedback on the Travelodge site saying I wasn&rsquo;t asking for refund, just wanted to point out their site was confusing an disorganized, which prompted them to call me saying I&rsquo;m not getting a refund and an argument about how a reservation I couldn&rsquo;t cancel was still a cancelable reservation. Do they hire ex-lawyers in customer service?</p>

<p>My latest example is State Farm. I&rsquo;ve contacted my local agent about filing a claim, before, and they&rsquo;re always pleasant to talk to, even when I&rsquo;m not getting satisfaction. This time, I decided to try their online claim submission. The one thing I like, once you log in, you can see all your policies. But after an arduous identification process (did you live at any of these places? Or these places? Or these places?), you end up filling out a form with minimal information (when did this happen? Did anyone get hurt?) and a 240-character field in which to actually describe the incident.</p>

<p>So with twitter-trained brevity I managed to convey what happened and that I had photos and receipts. A few days later, I got a call from an 888 number that went like this: &ldquo;Why did you wait until now to file a claim? Why didn&rsquo;t you file the claim earlier? I don&rsquo;t understand why you didn&rsquo;t file the claim immediately. Oh, and you can&rsquo;t file a claim until after we get a letter from the HOA saying they won&rsquo;t pay.&rdquo; I&rsquo;m still trying to reconcile how I can file a claim immediately but after waiting for the HOA board to meet and consider my compensation request (they meet only monthly and often not even then). I&rsquo;d have to say, after twelve years of paying premiums, State Farm wasn&rsquo;t there.</p>
