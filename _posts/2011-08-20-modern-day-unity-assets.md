I looked at the wikipedia article on Unity recently and was pleasantly surprised to see it link to [Assets](http://drupal.technicat.com/games/unity/assets) section of my Unity tutorial (it’s not really so much a tutorial perhaps as a guide, or, things I wrote down so I won’t forget?) Anyway, even though I updated it a little bit with a mention of the Asset Store a while ago, it could use some refreshing, since I started writing it back when Unity automatically gave you Standard Assets or Pro Standard Assets when you created a new project. Now there are so many starter assets, they’ve been separated into various packages.

And I only just realized that same asset import dialog also lists anything you’ve downloaded from the Asset Store (not for the first time, I could have used a “Scroll down you idiot!” user interface prompt).
