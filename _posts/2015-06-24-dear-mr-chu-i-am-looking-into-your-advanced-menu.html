title: Dear Mr. Chu, I am looking into your Advanced Menu script to use in a new program.
  However I am using Unity 5 with the Oculus Rift and when I apply this script to
  the OVR camera the game goes black. Would you happen to know how to fix this? (ps,
  how do i remove the main menu component)
