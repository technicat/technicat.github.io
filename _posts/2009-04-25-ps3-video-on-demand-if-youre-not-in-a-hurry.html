<p>To my dismay, nay, horror, I found myself left with only four cable stations a few days ago (and two of them are public access). Apparently, the cable company figured out I&rsquo;m not a paying customer. So I said, now I&rsquo;ll get some work done.</p>

<p>But first, let me try out the video download feature on my Playstation 3. Most of the movies aren&rsquo;t much cheaper than the packaged retail version, but I can watch that episode of Dollhouse that I missed for $1.99, or $2.99 for the HD version. Although the product heading says &ldquo;own&rdquo;, the description explains the rental policy (24 hours), which is a bit confusing, but I went ahead to checkout, where I first have to fill up my &ldquo;wallet&rdquo; with a minimum $5, enter my credit card number via the game controller (talk about button-mashing), and then start the download. &ldquo;264 minutes remaining&rdquo;. I can opt to download in the background or start playing the movie while downloading. Hit play - in crisp hi-def I see a reporter saying, &ldquo;the dollhouse&rdquo; - buffering, buffering - &ldquo;is&rdquo; - buffering, buffering. Forget it, now I&rsquo;ll get some work done.</p>

<p>But instead, I backed out, put in a Sarah Connor Chronicles DVD, four hours later, go the PS3 download manager - &ldquo;264 minutes reminaining&rdquo;. Guess it didn&rsquo;t continue downloading in the background. Open up the download task, see the progress continue at perhaps 0.5 MB/s (I&rsquo;m supposed to have 1.5MB/s and the test at speakeasy.net says I have a bit more). Back out of the task, it stops, go back in, it continues, and there&rsquo;s apparently no way to get it running in the background, now. OK, now I&rsquo;ll get some work done, but it&rsquo;s bedtime. So I leave it in there overnight, watch the Dollhouse episode in all it&rsquo;s glory the next morning.</p>

<p>Now, for tonight, I&rsquo;d better start downloading now. In the meantime, I&rsquo;ll watch C-SPAN 2. Or maybe I&rsquo;ll get some work done.</p>
