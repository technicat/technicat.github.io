<p>One thing I liked about The Sarah Connor Chronicles is the brief history lesson on chess computers and the reference to Deep Blue (and also the idea that a chess computer would dominate mankind - take that, Tron and Colossus!) So I dug up my old <a href="http://www0.epinions.com/review/Behind_Deep_Blue_Building_the_Computer_That_Defeated_the_World_Chess_Champion_by_Feng_Hsiung_Hsu/content_103459819140/show_~allcom">Epinion review</a> on Feng-Hsiung Hsu&rsquo;s book &ldquo;Behind Deep Blue: Building the  Computer That Defeated the World Chess Champion&rdquo;:</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve never been a particularly good chess player -  when I played on my high school chess team, my rating peaked at just  above 1700, which is, well, decent. But ever since I played and lost to  my first chess computer, I&rsquo;ve aspired to writing a great chess program.</p>

<p>I never got around to it, only writing a series of Othello programs on  various platforms, but the dream is still there. So I&rsquo;m quite taken with  Feng-Hsiung Hsu&rsquo;s twelve-year quest to build a chess computer capable  of beating the world chess champion.</p>

<p>There are really two major contests in this autobiographical account -  the well-publicized final match between Deep Blue and world champion  chess grandmaster Garry Kasparov, and the early political tension  between the original Deep Thought team at Carnegie-Mellon University and  the more established computer chess group led by Hans Berliner at the  same institution.</p>

<p>Hsu&rsquo;s irritation with these two major rivals comes through clearly, but  he does attempt to at least sound understanding of their respective  positions. The emotional level of disagreement and surprisingly petty  behavior (during and after the match, Kasparov insinuated that the Deep  Blue team cheated) highlight the fact that this was not just a game to  Kasparov and not just an academic exercise to the CMU researchers. All  the participants had the pride and work of a lifetime at stake, no less  than that of athletes seeking a championship ring or Olympic medal.</p>

<p>Chess and technology enthusiasts should find the level of computer  hardware and chess detail interesting, although others may find it  tedious. Hsu fails to provide any substantial discussion of other  computer chess research, which could lead the reader into thinking all  the interesting developments occurred during Deep Thought/Deep Blue&rsquo;s  development, when in fact, computer chess has been a rich topic for  decades. For example, one surprising omission - International Master  David Levy defeated Deep Thought in an early game, but Hsu doesn&rsquo;t note  that Levy is a well-known computer chess authority and would know how to  exploit typical weaknesses of chess programs as well as anyone.</p>

<p>Considering he&rsquo;s not a native English speaker, Hsu&rsquo;s writing is  passable, and his vocabulary is impressive, although the style is  somewhat stilted. There is at least one misspelling/typo (the Sports  Illustrated &ldquo;swim suite&rdquo; edition), but the most distracting aspect of  the writing is structural - Hsu recounts some events out of sequence,  referring to them back and forth, so I felt a little bit like the time  warping traveller in Slaughterhouse Five. For example, Hsu recounts a  1995 international computer chess tournament in Hong Kong before  discussing a 1994 tournament in the next chapter.</p>

<p>Compounding this confusion is the succession of names for the various  incarnations of the hardware - Deep Thought, Deep Thought II, Deep Blue,  Deep Blue Prototype, Deep Blue Jr. It&rsquo;s hard to remember the  differences between them (it&rsquo;s still not clear to me how Deep Blue Jr.  is different from Deep Blue, aside from being &ldquo;scaled down&rdquo;), and I had  to flip back the pages a few times to keep track of which version of the  hardware was playing at what tournament and when against whom.</p>

<p>The naming issue does provide the most humorous anecdote in this tale -  when the project was adopted by IBM, corporate insisted on changing the  name from Deep Thought, largely because of the trademark issue (Deep  Thought was named after the unhelpful computer in Douglas Adam&rsquo;s  Hitchhiker&rsquo;s Guide to the Galaxy), but also because a surprising number  of people, including a nun, kept referring to the computer as Deep  Throat.</p>

<p>In an attempt to explain his ambition and tendency to bump heads, Hsu  intersperses his narrative with some background on his early school  years in Taiwan, required service in the Taiwanese army, and his  activities at Carnegie-Mellon, but it&rsquo;s really unnecessary. His personal  style comes through loud and clear throughout the rest of the story and  there&rsquo;s no need to explain - some people just have the combination of  talent and contrariness to create something like Deep Blue, and in this  case, the world had the fortune to watch Hsu and Deep Blue bump heads  with a no less intense personality, Garry Kasparov.</p>
