<p>The nook app store started out as my favorite but somehow just got really bad, to the point where I rarely bother updating my apps there, anymore. Here&rsquo;s an example - I got an email reminding me to update my address, and then on the site it tells me that updating any information will take my apps of the store for up to two days. And they want you to open a ticket in addition to filling out the form. Which makes sense, I guess, since the form is missing from the page.</p>
