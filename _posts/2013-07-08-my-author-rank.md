Another neat feature of Amazon’s Author Central is the Author Rank, based on all your book sales on amazon.com (still, there’s no way to get kindle book sales numbers, for some reason, except for self-published ebooks). I think each of those big spikes below resulted from one purchase of my [essay book](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00703SOLC). The leveling up starting in April must be from presales (and recently, sales) of my [Unity book](http://learnunity4.com/). Cool, I made it to the top 100,000! (and it looks like there are over 500,000 authors?)
