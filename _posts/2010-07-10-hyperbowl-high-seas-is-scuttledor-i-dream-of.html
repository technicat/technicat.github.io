<p>My product strategy is part strategy, but more often reaction. Scratch that - it&rsquo;s strategy, reaction, and then saying I planned it that way all along. For example, when I started working on <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/hyperbowl/id344209253?mt=8">HyperBowl</a> for the iPhone last year, of course I didn&rsquo;t know about the upcoming iPad. Fortunately, 3D scales easily across screen resolution (as opposed to 2D) and Unity was ready, so that was a pretty easy transition. I gave up some immediately pricing flexibility in updating HyperBowl to a universal app instead of making a separate HyperBowl HD, but that simplifies things especially with the iPhone 4. If you have an iPhone app and an &ldquo;HD&rdquo; app, which one are you going to update to support the iPhone 4? Or will you create a new version of the app for that device?</p>

<p>I wonder about Apple&rsquo;s opinion on that, as they called me the other day to ask why I was selling HyperBowl and variations of HyperBowl each with individual lanes. In particular, I had recently submitted an update of HyperBowl that added High Seas, the fourth lane, and now I had a HyperBowl High Seas app in the approval queue. My official answer is that it appears to me that the iPhone app market can be segmented by price. There are those who are willing to pay a few dollars, those who only feel comfortable buying $.99 apps, and those who don&rsquo;t want to pay anything. And I know there are customers who are only interested in particular lanes (at least, every time I release a new version of HyperBowl, someone&rsquo;s asking about another lane I haven&rsquo;t implemented, yet), so I&rsquo;m trying to cater to that segment by releasing the lanes individually, and possibly making one or more of them free (I experimented with making <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/hyperbowl-classic/id322930268?mt=8">HyperBowl Classic</a> free for a while, but the ratings dropped, got more annoying reviews, someone cracked it and posted it on a piracy site, and it didn&rsquo;t seem to drive sales to the other apps, so, back to $.99&hellip;)</p>

<p>But the real reason for this product lineup is that when I started, I didn&rsquo;t know how many lanes I could get running on the iPhone since it took a lot of contortions to get the first lane, Classic, running, and each successive lane is larger. (the latest example is that I had to turn off the ship rocking in High Seas on the iPhone, as the iPad processor can handle the physics, but no on the older iPhones) So I released HyperBowl Classic, first, and if that was the first and last lane I could get running, then that&rsquo;s the whole product. Same reasoning for <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/hyperbowl-rome/id335726584?mt=8">HyperBowl Rome</a>. Once I got the third lane, <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/hyperbowl-forest/id344753703?mt=8">HyperBowl Forest</a>, running, then I thought I had enough to release an app called HyperBowl, with all three lanes, and I figured to be consistent I might as well release Rome as a separate app, too, and say, yeah, that&rsquo;s how I planned it all along to cater to the different pricing groups and reinforce the pricing point I chose for HyperBowl.</p>

<p>But Apple&rsquo;s stance, as I was told over the phone, is that I should use in-app purchases for that. Well, that&rsquo;s a valid point. I could have named HyperBowl Classic just HyperBowl for $.99 and added new lanes as in-app purchases each for $.99. In some sense, the pricing is clearer, though less flexible. And one of the promo code &ldquo;buyers&rdquo; of HyperBowl Classic suggested that. But at the time, I had my hands full just getting the app running at an acceptable frame rate (you could argue that didn&rsquo;t happen until later versions that took advantage of Unity iPhone static and dynamic batching of meshes), I didn&rsquo;t feel like messing around with trying to learn how to use Storekit and integrating with Unity (I&rsquo;m not sure the Enhancement Pack showed up early enough to help on that), and Storekit was introduced with iOS 3.0, which was new (in fact, the reviewer who suggested in-app purchases for lanes later gave me a one-star review for requiring iOS 3.0).</p>

<p>In any case, since there are only six HyperBowl lanes, and it&rsquo;s questionable whether I can get the remaining two running on iDevices, anyway, the Apple reviewer was willing to give me a pass this time, as long as I made some other changes to HyperBowl High Seas. Their point of view, he explained, is that they don&rsquo;t want all these apps that encourage you to buy other versions of those apps to level up with points or whatever, and he felt that&rsquo;s what I was doing. I disagreed, although I&rsquo;ve seen those apps and I don&rsquo;t quit understand them, and I opined that my setup was more like how developers have paid apps and &ldquo;lite&rdquo; versions of those apps. To my surprise, he said they&rsquo;re telling those developers the same thing - make one app and use in-app purchases. Now, I didn&rsquo;t want to argue with him - you can&rsquo;t fight city hall - and I&rsquo;d already decided the High Seas lane was getting to be too much trouble, but I had to ask, so what are you telling those other developers to do? After all, if you change a five dollar app into a $.99 or free app with in-app purchases, everyone who paid full price is going to get annoyed. His answer surprised me - developers in that situation are supposed to make the free app the main product with in-app purchases and somehow update the formerly main app with some points or whatever that the buyer can use to transition to the formerly lite version and level back up. But, he added, interestingly enough most developers just abandon the previous main product and create an entirely new app. Well, faced with the task of changing the lite app to use in-app purchasing, renaming it to the main app, renaming the main app to something else, adding some kind of ecommerce system to it just so those customers can transition to a formerly free app that&rsquo;s full of crappy reviews from the freeloader crowd&hellip;I&rsquo;d just start over again, too, or just abandon one of the apps.</p>

<p>In fact, that&rsquo;s my current thinking for the HyperBowl individual lanes. High Seas is just getting to be too much trouble - it&rsquo;s a hassle to build with old Unity and new XCode (especially targeting iOS 4), making the requested changes would make it differ from the other individual lanes, and I was never comfortable with releasing a lane that was not fully functional on the iPhone (vs. iPad), anyway. And as for the three other lanes already on the App Store, I think I&rsquo;ll stop updating them, but leave them on the App Store for those who only want to pay $.99. And since future HyperBowl releases will not support old OS&rsquo;s (I upgraded to iOS4 and there&rsquo;s no going back), the $.99 lanes will be available for those die-hards who don&rsquo;t want to upgrade. Yeah, that&rsquo;s how I planned it all along.</p>
