My rating: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1215935188">3 of 5 stars</a><br/><br/><a href="http://bit.ly/1ztg2q6">Learning iOS for Enterprise</a>  is the second review book I&rsquo;ve received from Packt Publishing. It&rsquo;s not quite as good as the previous one I reviewed (on Xamarain iOS development, as I recall). The biggest problem is the awkward writing and unpolished editing, for example a stretch of three sentences beginning with &ldquo;It&rdquo;, phrases like &ldquo;testing for you,&rdquo; and Smalltalk spelled as &ldquo;small-talk.&rdquo; And I have a quibble about the title: there is nothing specifically enterprise about this book. It doesn&rsquo;t even mention the Apple Developer Enterprise Program. Also, this is more of an general peeve, but it seems to me &ldquo;learn&rdquo; or &ldquo;learning&rdquo; in the title is unnecessary. Of course you&rsquo;re reading the book to learn. But this is also in issue with the Unity book I wrote.<br/><br/>Enterprise aside, I do like the collection of topics. I often buy multiple books in the same area because they each cover topics the other don&rsquo;t, which is pretty much unavoidable for any set of books about iOS development. I don&rsquo;t think the introduction to Objective-C programming and Xcode will be digestible by beginning programmers, and the topics are more recipe-size than in-depth treatments, but this is the first book I&rsquo;ve seen cover some nifty areas like exclusion paths in text views (text that can flow around areas) and the new Handoff and in iOS 8. And, while at first I was confused about the order of topics (the Activity Controller is introduced after the section on social integration), but I later appreciated they are presented in historical order, i.e., first pre-iOS 7, iOS 7, then iOS 8.
