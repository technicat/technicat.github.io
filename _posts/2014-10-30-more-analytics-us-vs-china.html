<p>Playing around with Unity Analytics some more, instead of iOS vs. Android today I compared users from US vs. China. I&rsquo;m totally surprised that I&rsquo;m getting more Chinese HyperBowl players. I guess it&rsquo;s a good thing that I added Chinese localization to the app and to the app store descriptions.</p>
