I feel like the last to know, but I just read the news that [The Sarah Connor Chronicles](http://www.sarahconnorchronicles.org/) won’t be picked up by Fox for next season. I’m shocked, shocked I say. The time slot did suck - even though it was my favorite show of last season and had an arc where you don’t want to miss an episode, I kept forgetting when it was on (Friday at 8pm - now I remember, but too late). But once I discovered the episodes available on the Playstation Store, I downloaded the episodes I missed onto my Playstation 3, and then ended up downloading all of Season 2 (leaving just enough room for a few episodes of [Breaking Bad](http://blogs.amctv.com/breaking-bad/) and [Dollhouse](http://www.dollverse.com/))

Speaking of Joss Whedon’s Dollhouse, I wonder if Fox decided that one Friday sci-fi show was enough for them. That would be ironic, considering Fox also killed Whedon’s Firefly, one of my all-time favorite TV shows (at least Fox is consistent). By the way, Firefly introduced Summer Glau to sci-fi fans, and there’s speculation that Glau will end up on Dollhouse. Maybe this is a devious master plan by Whedon. Or maybe while there’s nothing good on TV, I’ll have to invent my own conspiracy theories.
