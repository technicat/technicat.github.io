I started this blog site a few months ago because my sister suggested it and I remember reading a while back in a Tennessee Williams short story collection that he wrote a story every morning before trudging to his day job. And I figured, rather than bore everyone (including myself) with tales of my half-finished screenplay, I should make an effort to write once a day, at least as an exercise. But as with my Wii Fit, where the spirit is willing, the self-discipline is weak. I’ve blogged almost daily, but often I cheat. One of my fallbacks is to post a [WordsEye](http://www.wordseye.com/) graphic (at least it the scenes are generated from text). Another is to just write a few words about another site and link to it (the parasitic method). And finally, the Letterman technique - a top ten list (or Covey technique, if you can only come up with seven). Since one of my favorite shows, [Eureka](http://www.scifi.com/eureka/), just came back on the air, and it’s a weekend so most blog readers should be doing something more interesting than reading blogs (that’s what work time is for), here’s my top ten current hour-long series:

1. Battlestar Galactica (SciFi) - it’s been uneven the last couple of years, but I still can’t miss an episode
2. Eureka (SciFi) - I’m surprised it’s still on, never heard anyone talk about it, but it’s good science with good characters
3. The Closer (TNT) - Kera Sedgwick plays possibly the single best character on TV right now
4. Damages (FX) - amazing that a show with barely any humor can be so compelling, and that they can add a twist to every episode
5. Burn Notice (USA) - great to see Bruce Cambell on a regular show again, and Gabrielle Anwar, too!
6. Reaper (WB) - Kevin Smith’s slackers with day jobs in retail and moonlighting for the devil, an antidote to McG’s Chuck
7. Lost (ABC) - see The Shield
8. Monk (USA) - perhaps the funniest character on television, and great ensemble chemistry
9. The Shield (FX)- seems like it’s gone one season too long, but I still have to know how it ends
10. Psych (USA) - this has started growing on me, but it’s up for grabs (In Plain Sight, Saving Grace, The Sarah Connor Chronicles, Stargate Atlantis…) Forgot, Mad Men.
Thank the Lords of Kobol for basic cable!
