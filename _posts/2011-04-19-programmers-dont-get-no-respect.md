I discovered another benefit of self-publishing games - you can register at Comic Con as a professional and get in free (although, really it’s more prudent to just register earlier and pay the full price). Among the qualifying credentials - game credits, but not “programmer”, so I could have qualified this year since I credited myself on my self-published games, but without that title. Here’s what Comic Con says:

> A professional is someone who takes an active role in the creation, design, writing, editing, or production of comics, animation, films, books, videogames, or toys. Job titles might include writer, artist, penciller, inker, colorist, letterer, animator, designer, sculptor, editor, publisher, producer, actor, etc.

Ahem, are you forgetting someone? Animator, designer, editor, publisher, producer…don’t forget about us programmers (and yeah, no one remembers the sound guys, either). IndiCade leaves out the business types and just sticks with the art/design snoootiness:

> IndieCade invites independent game artists and designers from around the world to submit interactive media of all types.

I’d be willing to think that “designers” is intended to be inclusive (in which case “developers” seems like a better term - works well for GDC) except they add “artists” as an additional category. Gosh, I feel like we’re not in the “creative class”. Where’s my black turtleneck? Now I’m going to nurse my hurt feelings by reading the Game Developer Salary Survey. Ah, feeling better now…
