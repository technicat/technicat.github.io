The first Unity iPhone app that impressed me was Crazy Snowboard (it might even have been the first iPhone app of any that first impressed me). In particular, I thought the tilt control on the iPhone was really polished and felt natural. On the iPad, it still looks pretty good, but it seems to me tilt control in general is a bit more of a chore on the iPad due to its heft. Sort of feels like rotating a steering wheel that doesn’t have particularly good power assist. So, maybe for a driving game…
