<p>On a recent visit to Bend, Oregon, a resident there assumed I wasn&rsquo;t from this country. I haven&rsquo;t experienced much of that since I moved to California years ago, so, oh, that brought back some memories. Here&rsquo;s a top 10 list, in  no particular order.
</p><ol><li><em>&ldquo;Welcome to America!&rdquo;</em> From a heavily tattooed gentleman in Bend who then offered to sell me some weed.</li>
	<li><em>&ldquo;Where are you from?&rdquo;</em> This is a classic.</li>
	<li><em>&ldquo;Where are you really from?&rdquo;</em> Follow-on to number 2.</li>
	<li><em>&ldquo;Are you from Japan?&rdquo; </em>An oddly-specific variation.</li>
	<li><em>Handing me an English-as-a-Second-Language flyer.</em> On the main steps of MIT.</li>
	<li><em>&ldquo;Do you speak English?&rdquo;</em> What if I said no?</li>
	<li><em>&ldquo;How long have you lived in this country?&rdquo;</em> I usually give my age.</li>
	<li><em>&ldquo;You people are very polite and hard-working.&rdquo;</em> Shut up, I&rsquo;m napping.</li>
	<li><em>&ldquo;You guys hate Koreans, right?&rdquo;</em> Whaaa?</li>
	<li><em>Gibberish apparently intended to resemble Chinese</em>. Heard from children, punks in Boston, and an occasional NBA player.</li>
</ol>
