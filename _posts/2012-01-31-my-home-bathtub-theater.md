I finally figured out a useful place for my Apple TV - in the bathroom, where my cable TV can’t reach. Not only can I soak in the tub and watch shows or listen to tunes, the bathroom acoustics make it clearly audible even outside the bathroom (my Apple TV is singing in the shower…) - I’m listening to WSJ right now while I’m blogging in my home office…
