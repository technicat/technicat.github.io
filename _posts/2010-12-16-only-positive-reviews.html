<p>I was wondering why I was only seeing positive reviews of insurance plans on <a href="http://ehealthinsurance.com/">ehealthinsurance</a>, until I read this:</p>

<p><a href="http://itshardtofondlepenguins.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/Screen-shot-2010-12-07-at-4.54.37-PM.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4130" title="Screen shot 2010-12-07 at 4.54.37 PM" src="http://itshardtofondlepenguins.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/Screen-shot-2010-12-07-at-4.54.37-PM.png" alt="" width="547" height="143"/></a></p>

<p>If only they had this policy on the App Store. Kidding, of course (sort of).</p>
