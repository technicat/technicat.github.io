Amid all the hubbub surrounding the presidential race, there’s a pretty interesting contest going on around here, [Huntington Beach](http://www.ci.huntington-beach.ca.us/) Mayor [Debbie Cook](http://www.debbiecookforcongress.com/) challenging [Dana Rohrabacher](http://rohrabacher.house.gov/) for his congressional seat. I don’t know much about either except from [Cook’s wikipedia page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debbie_Cook) (interesting story of a suburban mom getting involved in local environmental issues, going to law school and then running for mayor, but reads like it was written by her people) televised [Huntington Beach City Council](http://www.ci.huntington-beach.ca.us/government/elected_officials/city_council/) meetings on[HBTV](http://huntingtonbeach.granicus.com/MediaPlayer.php?publish_id=3), and [Rohrabacher’s wikipedia page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dana_Rohrabacher) and all the taxpayer-paid newsletters he sends me.

Personally, Cook strikes me as fairly level headed and competent (e.g. in an exchange with Council member [Gil Coerper](http://www.gilcoerper.org/) about [public nudity](//articles.latimes.com/2007/jul/18/local/me-nakedman18)), and Rohrabacher, despite his long career in politics, strikes me as an alarmist idiot - The Mexicans are coming! An asteroid is falling! Boycott the Olympics! (although I admire the bravado and intent behind that last one)

But make up your own mind - you can research Rohrabacher’s voting record on [VoteSmart](http://votesmart.org/voting_category.php?can_id=26763) and see Cook in action in archival footage of the [Huntington Beach City Council meetings](http://huntingtonbeach.granicus.com/ViewPublisher.php?view_id=2).
