<p><a href="http://www.apple.com/downloads/dashboard/games/fugutype.html">FuguType</a> has been so successful (one sale!) that I released version 1.1. Really, I just wanted to try out the text-to-speech feature of MacOSX - now the falling words announce themselves before you type them into oblivion.</p>

<p>No fancy implementation - the widget just runs the &ldquo;say&rdquo; command in the shell. Try it yourself - double-click Applications/Utilities/Terminal.app and type<a href="http://www.fugutalk.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/05/anything.aiff"> &ldquo;say anything&rdquo;</a> in the shell window.</p>
