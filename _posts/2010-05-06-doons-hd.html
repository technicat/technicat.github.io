<p>Doons is an iPad game worth downloading. The controls are a bit flakey - I often unintentionally launched a block in the wrong direction after dragging to aim, releasing and then touching the screen to start aiming again. And the music started to sound repetitive after a few levels. But it&rsquo;s a polished game, as you can see it has good art, it&rsquo;s in &ldquo;HD&rdquo;, and it&rsquo;s free! (at least when I downloaded it)</p>
