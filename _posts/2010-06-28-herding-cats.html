<p>It&rsquo;s often said that managing programmers is like herding cats. Setting aside why anyone would want to do that, that analogy came to mind while I was sitting in my cat&rsquo;s vet&rsquo;s waiting room reading an article in Cat Fancy or something similar listing tips on managing multiple cats in the household.</p>

<p>Some of the advice clearly didn&rsquo;t apply, e.g. dealing with cat pheremones. Or if there is an analogy there, I don&rsquo;t want to delve into it. But some of the others sounded spot on. For example, introduce new cats slowly to avoid territorial reactions. Don&rsquo;t give more treats to one cat than the others. Provide an outlet for excess physical and mental energy. Don&rsquo;t allow bullying. And provide an area for basking in the sun.</p>
