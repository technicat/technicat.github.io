For now, all [my Unity Android apps](https://market.android.com/developer?pub=Technicat,+LLC) are built with an Android 2.2 requirement. The [Unity tested-device list](http://unity3d.com/support/documentation/Manual/Android-Devices%20That%20Have%20Been%20Tested.html) does include numerous Android 2.1 devices, but I’m testing on Android 2.2 (the Samsung Vibrant, which actually doesn’t work with Unity when running Android 2.1), so for now I’m playing it safe. The Android Market stats seems to show I’m not giving up too many customers:
