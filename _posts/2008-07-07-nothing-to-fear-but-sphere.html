<p>After posting a jab at CNN, I was surprised to receive a snippety comment on the post. First reaction: mild annoyance. Second reaction: gratification that for once it wasn&rsquo;t spam (relatively new to blogging, I&rsquo;m surprised and occasionally fooled by the automated posts, like &ldquo;I like your writing&hellip;blah, blah, blah&hellip; please put me on your blogroll&rdquo;). Third reaction: who&rsquo;s reading this blog, and why are they reading it if they&rsquo;re so offended?

But I checked my web access log a while later (one annoying side effect of the blog wave - now it&rsquo;s confusing to  call web server access logs &ldquo;web logs&rdquo;, like I used to), and found I&rsquo;m getting traffic from the CNN web page I linked to on my post, although I don&rsquo;t bother with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trackback">trackbacks</a>. Turns out CNN uses the blog search tool from <a href="http://www.sphere.com/">Sphere</a> that finds content out there that links to your post. I was similarly surprised to see that happen when I linked to a Google blog, but it makes sense - they use Google. Like I said, I&rsquo;m relatively new to this stuff (but I&rsquo;ll never call myself a &ldquo;newbie&rdquo;. Or buy a Dummies book. Matter of principal.)

Sphere looks like an interesting company. Their Jobs page asks for:
</p><ol><li>Great communication skills. Weâ€™re a virtual team, so frequent and clear written communication is a must.</li>
	<li>Adaptability in a changing environment. Our business is changing and growing fast; self leadership is the path to success.</li>
	<li>Expertise and vision. Bring something unique to the team.</li>
</ol>
and applications in the form of:
<ol><li>your resume</li>
	<li>a description of what you have to offer us</li>
	<li>a description of what you want to get from us</li>
</ol>
Apparently they&rsquo;re a virtual company just like mine. Except for the investors (they must have paid a pretty penny for sphere.com), employees and product!
