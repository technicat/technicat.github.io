<p>Catching up on trying out all the free stuff I downloaded from the Unity Asset Store, the latest experiment is with the Skeleton Pack. It&rsquo;s a pretty good-looking skeleton, and it&rsquo;s got a nice dance animation, among others, so I repurposed the Android version of my <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.technicat.ElektraDance">Elektra Dance</a> app and created a <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.technicat.fugudance">Fugu Dance</a> app. I thought about calling it Skeleton Dance, but there are plenty of other apps with something like that name - also considered Dancing Bones, but I want to hold open the possibility of adding more non-skeletal characters.</p>
