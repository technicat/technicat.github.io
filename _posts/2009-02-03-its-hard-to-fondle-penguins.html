I&rsquo;ve noticed before that film and television characters of high technical caliber are by default MIT grads (notwithstanding the Dallas car salesman who asked me if MIT was in Minnesota). But lately, it seems on-screen MIT is getting cooler. The Jeff Goldblum character in Independence Day was not Revenge of the Nerds nerdy, but he was pretty nerdy. The MIT grad in NCIS is a nerd, but a nerd who packs a gun. And the tech-savvy security guy in the series Vegas seems too cool for school, not to mention MIT.

The portrayals lack some authentic details, though, including, if memory serves:
</p><ul><li>Real MIT students have a &ldquo;concentration&rdquo;, which is one or two numbers, not a major with a name (especially not &ldquo;computer forensics, like on NCIS).</li>
	<li>Real MIT students say &quot;that&rsquo;s orthogonal&rdquo; when presented with an irrelevant issue.</li>
	<li>Real MIT students start off the day by talking about how many hours of sleep they didn&rsquo;t get last night. Or the night before.</li>
	<li>Real MIT students will utter &ldquo;IHTFP&rdquo; when placed in an uncomfortable situation.</li>
</ul>
I can&rsquo;t wait to see a character with these traits on TV - imagine a sleep-deprived investigator who intersperses numbers and &ldquo;that&rsquo;s orthogonal&rdquo; into his or her speech, joneses for the dun-dun noodles at Mary Chung, and curses &ldquo;IHTFP&rdquo; before every gun battle. Oh yeah, our hero should wear a really ugly ring.
