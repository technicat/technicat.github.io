About the only thing you can control on the App Store to promote your apps, besides clever wording, is the frequency of releases. You can adjust the displayed released date of your app one per release (it doesn’t happen automatically) and then customers browsing the recent releases can actually find it. My app release and upgrade dates are easily discerned from the spikes on this graph:

Apple recommends two week intervals for major bug-fix releases and monthly for feature updates. Hey, it’s agile development!
