<p>I like the <a href="http://nabitablet.com/">Nabi tablet</a>, but I&rsquo;m not crazy about their app store. The good news: There&rsquo;s no annual or sign-up fee. But, while it&rsquo;s not as bad as handster (now under Opera), it makes you appreciate the polish of the big three Android stores (Google, Amazon, Nook), and of course, Apple. For one thing, it&rsquo;s not easy to find. To submit apps, you have to sign up at <a href="http://fuhuapps.com/">fuhuapps.com</a> (the folks at Zeemote tipped me off). As far as I can tell, there&rsquo;s no web storefront, so you can&rsquo;t link to your apps. The screenshots are required to be in a phone-sized resolution instead of the Nabi tablet resolution, so clearly they acquired some third-party appstore and didn&rsquo;t get around to updating that part. I have a couple of apps that never made it through because of some weird glitch.</p>

<p>It seemed to me that ad-supported apps weren&rsquo;t such a great idea on a tablet oriented to kids, but for <a href="http://hyperbowl3d.com/">HyperBowl</a> I have around 4000 downloads of the free version and just $25 in sales for the paid version, since last September. The payment terms make me appreciate, again, the top app stores. Instead of monthly payments with no minimum, fuhuapps only pays quarterly, within 90 days (what, do they think they&rsquo;re book publishers?) and according to the message on my dashboard below, my $25 payment due has not exceeded the $10 minimum threshold. I sent a query to customer support and haven&rsquo;t heard back.</p>
