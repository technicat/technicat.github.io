My rating: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1191386258">3 of 5 stars</a><br/><br/>
I found a bunch of bizarrely chauvenistic aphorisms, while memorable in themselves, really didn&rsquo;t function well as a mnemonic device for learning Korean. If those were really the basis for Korean writing (while reading this book, I was wondering if the author was pushing a personal philosophy or attempt at humor), I&rsquo;m disappointed. I initially was so impressed at the design of the Korean writing system that I thought it was worthy of a science fiction writer (Klingon, move over).
