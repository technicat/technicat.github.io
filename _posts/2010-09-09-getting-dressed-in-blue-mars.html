<p>I had some BLU$ burning a hole in my pocket, so I went on a shopping binge. This is why I don&rsquo;t go clothes shopping in real life - here I&rsquo;m trying out a caveman outfit, and I went nuts with the layering system. Got a striped shirt underneath, and even two hairpieces. I think it works for me.</p>
