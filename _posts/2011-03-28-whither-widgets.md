Since I got [Fugu Maze](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/fugu-maze/id426993175?mt=12) on the Mac App Store, I’m wondering what to do about my [Fugu Games](http://fugugames.com/) widgets that I listed on the Apple download site. On the one hand they’re old, not actively maintained and don’t generate any revenue. On the other hand, I still had five thousand downloads of them this month (How to turn those into paying customers? Problem to be solved later). In any case, looks like the [Apple download site](http://www.apple.com/downloads/) is disappearing - the page now mainly describes the Mac App Store. It does still point to the [widget listing](http://www.apple.com/downloads/dashboard/just_added/). but recent additions are sparse - either developers are losing interest or Apple has stopped accepting them (or both).
