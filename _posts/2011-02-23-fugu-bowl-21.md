After nine days, [Fugu Bowl 2.1](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/fugubowl/id297032758?mt=8) was approved on the App Store yesterday. Originally, this app was an experimental testbed for [HyperBowl](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/hyperbowl/id344209253?mt=8) controls, but it’s continued in a guinea pig role. I think it’s the first app I made universal, when the iPad came out, and the in the last release I tried out iAds, using the plugin from [Prime31 Studios](http://prime31.com/). This latest update tried out [Unity 3.2](http://unity3d.com/), two more Prime31 plugins (the Etcetera plugin for the Rate feature, and the Game Center plugin), and GUIKit001 from [GameAssets.net](http://gameassets.net/) for the pause menu.

Interestingly, Fugu Bowl is also my best “selling” app, with 75,000 non-upgrade downloads. I only just noticed on [App Annie](http://appannie.com/) that the app has been included in “What’s Hot” in several non-US app stores. Maybe simple apps without a lot of non-localized text do better worldwide? (the far more complex HyperBowl app has most of its sales in the US and British commonwealth)
