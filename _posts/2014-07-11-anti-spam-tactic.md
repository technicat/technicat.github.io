Trying to turn lemons into lemonade, here, with this reply to a Time Warner Business Cable email…

> I’ve given up trying to get Time Warner to stop with the junk email and telemarketing calls, so instead, I would like to return the favor and urge everyone in your company to buy my products. Please visit [http://hyperbowl3d.com/](http://hyperbowl3d.com/) and [http://fugugames.com/](http://fugugames.com/) to buy and download my mobile games, available on the App Store and Google Play, and check out [http://learnunity4.com/](http://learnunity4.com/) for information on my game programming book available at your neighborhood Barnes and Noble and on Amazon and other online bookstores.
