[FuguType](http://www.apple.com/downloads/dashboard/games/fugutype.html) has been so successful (one sale!) that I released version 1.1. Really, I just wanted to try out the text-to-speech feature of MacOSX - now the falling words announce themselves before you type them into oblivion.

No fancy implementation - the widget just runs the “say” command in the shell. Try it yourself - double-click Applications/Utilities/Terminal.app and type[“say anything”](http://www.fugutalk.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/05/anything.aiff) in the shell window.
