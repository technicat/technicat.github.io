<p>The game industry has some Hollywood envy - witness game producers who&rsquo;d rather be film producers, and game designers who&rsquo;d rather be writing screenplays. As a result, we have game studio execs who have to be spoon-fed &ldquo;high-concept&rdquo; descriptions of games, the dominance of licenses and sequels, and Bruckheimer-Bay style cinematics.</p>

<p>But game development has one type of IP reuse that is quite worthy - the port. Film remakes have questionable value (&ldquo;reimaginings&rdquo; are a bit more interesting), but game ports keep games alive. A pixel-perfect reproduction of an old game on modern hardware is useful enough, but even better are new versions that take advantage of the latest technology and even add content. As an example, here are a couple of promo trailers for WiiWare ports from <a href="http://www.nicalis.com/">Nicalis</a>:</p>
