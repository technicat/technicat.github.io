<p>For a while, I had some system info displayed in some of my Unity apps, partly for my own benefit and partly to assist customers in reporting useful device information (wishful thinking, perhaps). I ended up removing some of it after Amazon rejected HyperBowl initially for displaying &ldquo;technical gibberish&rdquo;, but it remains alive in <a href="https://market.android.com/details?id=com.technicat.fugusystem">Fugu System</a>Â on Android (not on the App Store - Apple rejected it as having not enough entertainment value), which I envisioned as some hybrid between a 3D benchmarking app and one of those system info apps showing device ID&rsquo;s, memory usage, etc. (never mind Unity doesn&rsquo;t have all those functions). In any case, the info display code serves as an example usage of the various Unity system info functions:</p>

<p><code><br/>
function Start() {<br/>
guiText.text = "Device ID: "+SystemInfo.deviceUniqueIdentifier+"n"+<br/>
SystemInfo.deviceModel+"n"+<br/>
SystemInfo.operatingSystem+" "+SystemInfo.systemMemorySize + "MBn"+<br/>
SystemInfo.processorCount+" "+SystemInfo.processorType+"n"+<br/>
SystemInfo.graphicsDeviceName+" "+SystemInfo.graphicsMemorySize+"MBn"+<br/>
Screen.width+"x"+Screen.height+" pixelsn"+<br/>
"Multitouch "+(Input.multiTouchEnabled ? "yes" : "no")+<br/>
" Gyroscope "+(Input.isGyroAvailable ? "yes" : "no")+"n"+<br/>
Application.systemLanguage.ToString();<br/>
}</code></p>
