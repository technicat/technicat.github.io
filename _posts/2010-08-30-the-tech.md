I found this evidence on the net of my short-lived career as an MIT journalist. I forgot how much fun rush week was - basically, after you get flushed out of a couple of jock fraternities, you run around campus and try out all the activities, like the student newspaper, [The Tech](http://tech.mit.edu/). So for one night of paste-up, Iâ€™m listed here with the rather well known tech writer [Simson Garfinkel](http://simson.net/page/Bio).
