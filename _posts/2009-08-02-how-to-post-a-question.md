There’s an art to posting programming questions in an efficient, professional and informative manner. Over the years, from mail lists to Usenet to forums, I’ve come to learn some classic effective techniques:

1. Make the title of the post really vague, e.g. “I Need Help” or “A Coding Problem”. Feel free to add a lot of exclamation marks and/or question marks. Anyone browsing the forum will be intrigued and unable to resist reading the post.
2. Also describe the problem vaguely. Omit useful details like error messages, the functions you’re using, the line of code in question, or what you’re actually trying to accomplish. After all, if you knew all that, chances are you’d have the answer, already.
3. Or go the other extreme and overwhelm with detail. You can actually do both - post a huge blob of code and ask “why doesn’t this work?”
4. Write as if you’re texting or twittering. Avoid whole words and complete sentences. Better yet, write in a single run-on sentence. Save all that careful spelling and punctuation for coding.
5. Don’t waste time reading your post before submitting it. Hit the Submit button as soon as you hit that last key. Ignore the Preview button - that’s for people who worry about offending others.
6. Don’t read the manual. Reading the documentation for a function takes almost as much time as asking someone else to read it for you.
7. If you do read the manual, and you found it incomplete or just hard to understand, don’t tell anyone. Wait for someone to tell you to read the manual, and then you can submit another post saying you did read the manual.
8. If no one answers, don’t add any additional clarification or thought to the question. Just throw in some more question marks and and ask “why isn’t anyone helping me?”
9. If you don’t like an answer, take offense. After all, someone is wasting your time with free advice.
10. If you really don’t like an answer, go on the offensive. The Internet is a great place to get the last word.
