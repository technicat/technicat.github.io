<p>It took me a while to figure this out, but here&rsquo;s how to test your Unity NaCl build right after the build. In Chrome, go to Preferences, select Extensions, check Developer Mode. This will make available the &ldquo;Load unpacked extension&hellip;&rdquo; button. Use that to select the build folder, and then it&rsquo;s installed just like any extension from the Chrome webstore.</p>
