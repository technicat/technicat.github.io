I’m still buying Brother laser printers…

_Originally written on Epinions in April 2003:_

The first time I ever used a laser printer was in my college years, in the MIT AI Lab. I only vaguely remember the make and model - I believe it was called the Dover and manufactured by Xerox - but I do remember it was big, maybe the size of my sofa, and slow. And just about everyone in the building shared it.

Fast forward seventeen years to now, and my, times have changed. The newest addition to my home office is the Brother HL-1440, a monochrome laser printer occupying a footprint just over one foot on each side. This is my first personal laser printer, a reaction to the high print cartridge costs of my old inkjet printer. It features both a USB and a parallel port interface, one manual and one letter-size tray paper feed with a 250-page capacity.

Installation on my Windows XP system was straightforward - the drivers and manual are on the CD-ROM (although I am always annoyed when a hardcopy of the documentation is not provided) and also available on the Brother web site.

Since then, I’ve moved the printer over to my Linux system (Red Hat 7.2) as a print server for my local network. The Brother web site does not feature any Linux drivers, but the printer seems to operate correctly with Brother 1250 driver already installed on my server.

Although printing cost was my primary motivation for switching from an ink-jet to a laser printer, the print speed of the HL-1440 has also been a big improvement. From my usage so far, it does whiz along at the advertised 15 page-per-minute for all-text documents at the default 600x600dpi print resolution, but expect longer print times for graphics. A document consisting of 7 text pages and 13 images took three minutes.

The print time varies with the print resolution. For example, the aforementioned text/graphics document took only two minutes at 300x300dpi, and over nine minutes at 1200x600dpi. The lower resolution was barely noticeable on the text but quite evident on the graphics. The higher resolution added some contrast to the graphics, but otherwise no marked improvement. In any case, the 1200x600 setting often results in printed “out of memory” error pages unless the built-in 2MB of memory is augmented with up to an additional 32MB using the available SIMM slot. I recommend just sticking with the default 600x600dpi setting.

The printer rarely jams, but when it does, you have to check and clear three different areas - the paper tray, the drum (accessible from the front cover), and the rear paper exit, which is used when printing on heavy stock. I had one reoccuring jam due to a tiny shred of paper left in the drum area, which I had neglected to inspect.

The original paper misfeed was probably caused by curled paper from a previous print session - I was trying to reuse the paper by replacing it upside down in the tray. It was some form of general-purpose Staples paper, so perhaps a higher-quality stock would have performed better (the manual lists recommended paper parameters and brands). However, note that the HL-1440 does have a duplex print mode that requires replacing the paper upside down in the tray as I did.

Cartridge replacement is simple - pull open the front cover, extract the drum, pop out the old cartridge and put in the new. The manual instructs you to slide a built-in cleaning wire back and forth prior to reinserting the drum. (Easy enough to comply, but somehow it feels like a magic ritual - chant the name of Brother three times, then perform a dance to the toner gods, and you will be rewarded with good print quality)

I had to replace the toner cartridge (about $50 at my neighborhood office superstore) after somewhere between 3000-4000 pages, which is consistent with the advertised 3000 page rating for each cartridge. The printer starts blinking one of its cryptic warning light combinations (this is where the manual comes in handy) when the toner is running low, and then the warning light stays on when the toner cartridge must be replaced. I am surprised that the printer flat out refuses to print at this point - every other laser printer I’ve used would continue to print until the degraded print quality prompted someone to replace the cartridge. In this case, my print quality was still good when I replaced the cartridge, so I suspect a designed-in revenue stream. I did try tilting the toner cartridge (by shaking the whole printer - not recommended, but that shows you how light it is) in case the toner was uneven, but to no effect.

Besides lowering the print resolution to 300x300 dpi, I could try saving on toner by selecting the toner-save mode in the Print Preferences dialog, but the trade-off is a noticeably lighter printout. Next time I replace the cartridge, I may try reusing the last one I took out - that tactic did work with my old inkjet printer.

You can think of the cartridge replacement process as a dress rehearsal for the drum replacement. According to the manual, the drum requires replacement after 20,000 pages. At my current usage, I’ll need a drum replacement after a year. I see the drum listed at about $150 online, but for the “fixing unit”, “separator pad holder assy” and “pick up roller assy” listed by the manual for replacement after 50,000 pages, a call to customer support is necessary. For me, that should be between 2-3 years from now - I predict at that point I’ll just get a new laser printer.

All told, estimating a half cent per page for paper, just over a penny per page for toner, a third of a penny for the drum, and a 50,000 page lifespan for the whole printer, which cost me a bit over $200, I’m figuring between two and two-and-a-half cents per page. Combine that with the performance, print quality, and ease of use, I’d say this is a pretty good personal and home-office system, but not suitable for heavy duty and corporate use.
