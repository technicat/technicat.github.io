[![12111](http://itshardtofondlepenguins.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/12111.jpg "12111")](http://wordseye.com/view-picture?sid=12111)This weekend, thanks to Daylight Savings Time, I instantly moved ahead in time one hour. After watching Lost this season, I was disappointed the experience wasn’t accompanied by a blinding flash of light. But it did make me think of some time travel stories that have made an impression on me:

- This year, of course, it’s Lost, that somehow keeps a story that looks like it’s going to veer out of control moving along and constantly suspenseful. The biggest mystery - did the writers plan this all along or were they making it up?
- A Sound of Thunder - the original Ray Bradbury story, not the movie. Gives the “butterfly effect” a whole new meaning.
- Bill and Ted’s Excellent Adventure
- Timecop - when will Van Damme receive his lifetime achievement award?
- The Robert Heinlein story in which a man travels back in time and fathers himself
- The Star Trek: Deep Space Nine episode in which the crew travels back to Roswell
- The Star Trek: Next Generation episode in which Data’s detached head is unearthed
- The Futurama episodes that riff on the previous three
- The Terminator
- The Sarah Connor Chronicles - it’s got enough going on that it deserves to be separated from the movies
