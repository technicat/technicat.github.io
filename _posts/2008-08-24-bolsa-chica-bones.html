<p>My regular weekend routine includes randomly dropping into open house showings of properties I still can&rsquo;t afford. But the realtors are pretty cool about it (often complaining the owners need to get real and drop the price further).</p>

<p>On a recent drop-by, I mentioned how nice the <a href="http://www.brightwaterhb.net/">Brightwater</a> development on the <a href="http://bolsachica.org/">Bolsa Chica</a> wetlands was turning out, despite the <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-bolsa27nov27,1,7770023.story?coll=la-headlines-california&amp;ctrack=1&amp;cset=true">birds-slamming-into-a-wall fiasco</a>, and the realtors informed me of another controversy - regular <a href="http://natube.magnify.net/item/BNDTHT6THDFWT3F4">local demonstrations</a> over alleged <a href="http://ocvoice.wordpress.com/2008/04/01/bury-my-heart-at-brightwater/">mishandling of Native American burial sites</a> by the developer.</p>

<p>This isn&rsquo;t the first time this has happened - similar controversy arose (after the fact) with the <a href="http://articles.latimes.com/1997/nov/03/local/me-49809">Harbor Cove</a> development in Newport Beach. Haven&rsquo;t these guys seen <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0084516/">Poltergeist</a>?</p>
