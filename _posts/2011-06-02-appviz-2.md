I upgraded to [AppViz 2](http://appviz.com/) today, which addresses the two major issues I had with the original AppViz - tracking iAd sales and the lack of a cumulative sales graph that also showed the breakdown among multiple products. The way to show that is in the Dashboard, which now has a customizable time range like the Graph display (and both have convenient drop-down selectors for typical time periods, like last seven days, last 30 days, all, etc.)

The yellow is [HyperBowl](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/hyperbowl/id344209253?mt=8), the red is [Fugu Maze](http://itunes.apple.com/app/fugu-maze/id295808255?mt=8) and the orange denotes iAd revenue from [Fugu Bowl](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/fugubowl/id297032758?mt=8), the top speckles at the end are from [Fugu Maze on the Mac App Store](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/fugu-maze/id426993175?mt=12), and the rest are the individual HyperBowl lanes that are now free. Ainâ€™t it pretty?
