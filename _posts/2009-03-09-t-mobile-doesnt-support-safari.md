After several failures logging in to my T-mobile account in Safari, I tried Firefox and it worked. Belatedly, I googled for the problem and found this [report](http://discussions.apple.com/thread.jspa?messageID=9093129) that says T-mobile doesn’t support Safari. A huge telcom can’t test more than two browsers? In this economy, they can’t hire one more QA person? Are they still waiting to see if this Mac thing will take off? Or are they peeved at the exclusive AT&T iPhone deal? I guess I should be relieved they don’t just support Internet Explorer, but now I have to install Firefox just to pay my phone bill!
