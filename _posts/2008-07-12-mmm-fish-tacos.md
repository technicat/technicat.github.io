In the mood for [Vietnamese noodles](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuisine_of_Vietnam), I wandered down to [Sunset Beach](http://www.beachcalifornia.com/sunset.html) the other day to a restaurant in Pete’s Landing only to find it closed. Although [Little Saigon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Saigon) is right next door, it’s tough sledding here in [Huntington Beach](http://www.surfcityusa.com/) for any Asian restaurant that doesn’t serve [Americanized Chinese food](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Chinese_cuisine) or have “Panda” in its name. So I fell back to Woody’s Diner and tried their fish tacos. It’s not the obvious place to order fish tacos, but it was all right and I was surprised by the presentation:[![](http://itshardtofondlepenguins.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/img00062.jpg "img00062")](http://itshardtofondlepenguins.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/img00062.jpg)If there’s one dish that’s emblematic of Southern California, I vote for the fish taco. Some of the specialists:

- [Rubio’s](http://www.rubios.com/) - good fish tacos from a fast food chain. As opposed to bad fish tacos from a fast food chain (Del Taco)
- [Wahoo’s](http://www.wahoos.com/) - Asian/Mexican/Brazilian blend with a surfing vibe
- Taco Mesa - local favorite with a huge selection
- [Chronic Tacos](http://www.eatchronictacos.com/) - always a line, thought not a personal favorite of mine
