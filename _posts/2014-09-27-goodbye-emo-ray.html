<p>Another virtual world bites the dust. It appears Playstation Home will be shutting down. Too bad, but not unexpected - I know Playstation owners who don&rsquo;t even know they have Home on their systems. Home is one of two virtual worlds I&rsquo;ve worked on (in?) during the phase where many attempted to create the second Second Life (the other one I worked on/in is Blue Mars - still running as far as I know).</p>

<p>I contributed to the development of two games within Home, an RC Rally game and a bloody teddy-bear shooting game called Emo-Ray. Thing thing about virtual worlds (and server-based games in general), when it&rsquo;s gone, it&rsquo;s gone. All that remain are the YouTube videos.</p>
