Abstractly, I know that ad targeting is going on and don’t really think about it, but once in a while it can get creepy. Take this Facebook ad - “Men LOVE This GAME !” (and what’s with the capitalization? Some people should have their shift keys removed). Could have been worse - based on my profile, it could have said “45-year old Men in Huntington Beach LOVE This GAME!”
