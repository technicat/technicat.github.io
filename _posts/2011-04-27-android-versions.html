The <a href="http://unity3d.com/support/documentation/Manual/Android-Devices%20That%20Have%20Been%20Tested.html">Unity tested-device list</a> does include numerous Android 2.1 devices, but I&rsquo;m testing on Android 2.2 (the Samsung Vibrant, which actually doesn&rsquo;t work with Unity when running Android 2.1), so for now I&rsquo;m playing it safe. The Android Market stats seems to show I&rsquo;m not giving up too many customers:</p>
