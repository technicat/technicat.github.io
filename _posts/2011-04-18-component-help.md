I have mixed feelings when I discover features that would have saved me a lot of time if I’d noticed them before. Case in point, it’s only after reading the Unify community wiki [Tip of the Day](http://www.unifycommunity.com/wiki/index.php?title=Tip_of_the_day) that I noticed the little question mark displayed in the upper right Inspector display of built-in Unity components, which clicked upon will bring up the corresponding documentation.
