<p>It&rsquo;s surprisingly difficult to find to find the embed code for a YouTube playlist, even though I&rsquo;ve done it once before. I can create, view, modify, share the playlist, but no embed code in sight. Must have been one of those reorgs. This time, I found it by going to View Public Channel, select Playlists from the bar at top, select the Playlist name, and you get an embed box at top. So it&rsquo;s easier to embed your playlist if you&rsquo;re not logged in to your account. Anyway, here&rsquo;s a playlist with the  HyperBowl video I just created plus some others I found on YouTube.</p>
