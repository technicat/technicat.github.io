<p>I&rsquo;m well past the point where I have old versions of functions I don&rsquo;t want to use, particularly as I&rsquo;m replacing JavaScript with C#, but I&rsquo;m afraid to take them out because I might still be using them somewhere. Ideally, I&rsquo;d have some Editor script that would root them out, but in the meantime, it&rsquo;s also nice to have some kind of deprecation warning (I think I used to be able do that in some other language, maybe Common Lisp, but it&rsquo;s been so long&hellip;)</p>

<p>So I cobbled up a really simple logging function, in a namespace/class Fugu.Log, that warns a deprecated script is in use:</p>

<p><code><br/>
public static void Deprecate (MonoBehaviour script) {<br/>
Debug.LogWarning("Deprecated script attached to "+script.gameObject.name);<br/>
}<br/></code></p>

<p>and then I put this in the Awake or Start callback of the deprecated script:</p>

<p><code><br/>
Fugu.Log.Deprecate(this);<br/></code></p>

<p>Then hit Play and check the Console. By the way, I did try adding System.ObsoleteAttribute but haven&rsquo;t seen it do anything (at least in JavaScript).</p>
