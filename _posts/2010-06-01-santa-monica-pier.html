<p>While attending Digital Hollywood a few weeks ago, I made a point of checking out the Santa Monica Pier. You&rsquo;ve probably seen it on TV or film numerous times (an episode of The Sarah Connor Chronicles comes to mind). As usual, I just had my limited Blackberry Pearl camera, but I think this photo came out kind of cool.</p>
