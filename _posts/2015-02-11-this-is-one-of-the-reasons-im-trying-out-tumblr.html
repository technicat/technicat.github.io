<img src="/tumblr_files/tumblr_njlqas2ReY1tgne1po1_1280.png"/><br/><p>This is one of the reasons I&rsquo;m trying out tumblr right now. After moving my wordpress blog from dreamhost to arvixe, I kept running into this 1MB upload limit, despite updating the php init file. Turns out, this error only kicks in when I upload from my OSX Photos shortcut. But that&rsquo;s where I usually want to upload something from.</p>
