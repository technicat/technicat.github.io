Wooglie has an option to embed one of the wooglie-deployed games into your own web page (including the wooglie ads, idea being that allowing others do deploy will bring in more ad-sharing revenue). Can’t do it in this blog (well, you can, but seems the iframe will take over the whole wordpress blog page), but here’s a screenshot of embedded [HyperBowl on Wooglie](http://www.wooglie.com/playgame.php?gameID=156):
