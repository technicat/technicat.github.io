<p>If I&rsquo;d tried harder (or at all) in art class and learned something, anything about creating audio, I&rsquo;d be all set as one-man game development shop, but I think I&rsquo;m fortunate that the relevant skill I do have is programming.
</p><ul><li>I can do builds whenever I want. I am the build master. As I have a bug fix or something new I want to try (and then the bug fix comes after that), I can publish immediately to the Android Market and submit immediately to any other app store. For non-programmers, it&rsquo;s hard enough just explaining what&rsquo;s involved in setting up an Apple developer account, much less generating a distribution build from an XCode project.</li>
	<li>I can find plenty of ready-to-use audio and art, e.g. on the Unity Asset Store. There&rsquo;s also plenty of ready-to-modify code, but contrary to popular opinion, you&rsquo;re headed for disappointment if you drop in code written by someone else and expect it to do exactly what you want.</li>
	<li>I can find plenty of artists and audio designers as potentially interested partners (and game designers and business people for that matter, but the last thing I need are more ideas and people with magic formulas for success). But just check the <a href="http://forum.unity3d.com/index.php">Unity forums</a> and you&rsquo;ll see how hard it is to attract good programmers without actually paying them (a non-pittance).</li>
	<li>I can port. Give me all the source assets for a game that used to run on something, and I can get it to run on something else. Take <a href="http://hyperbowl3d.com/">HyperBowl</a>. I updated the original code just enough so I could get it running just enough so I could write an exporter using the FBX SDK so I could import the original assets into Unity so I could script a new implementation of the game. All coding.</li>
	<li>I can debug. Reading and reasoning about code helps withÂ  that.</li>
	<li>I can report bugs. Ditto.</li>
	<li>I can figure out what&rsquo;s possible. Will this work? I can read the doc and/or try it and find out. Sorry, this runs at 5fps.</li>
	<li>I can find decent-paying work when I come to the realization that my app revenue is not covering my expenses. That&rsquo;s not quite as true for artists and audio designers. Sorry, life (or the video game industry) is not fair.</li>
</ul>
But artists and musicians can take comfort - we still envy you guys. I don&rsquo;t expect to ever be in a &ldquo;Programmer&rsquo;s Alley&rdquo; at E3 autographing printouts of my code.
