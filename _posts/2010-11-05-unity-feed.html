<p><a href="http://itunes.apple.com/app/unity-feed/id400855804?mt=8">Unity Feed</a>, a compilation of Unity RSS feeds, is now on the App Store. I created this as a test of <a href="http://appmakr.com/">AppMakr</a>, but it&rsquo;s actually something I thought I&rsquo;d find useful for myself, since there are no so many disparate official Unity channels - news, blogs, the forum, the feedback/feature site, the answers (stackoverflow-style) site&hellip;and in fact I do use the app on my iPod touch to check on Unity news while I&rsquo;m vegetating on the couch.</p>
