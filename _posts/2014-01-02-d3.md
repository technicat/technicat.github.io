It’s a new year and time for another web site look. My last makeover of my [Fugu Games](http://fugugames.com/) site was implemented in PHP so I could read the tsv files exported by [AppViz](http://appviz.com/). But a colleague recently suggested I look at [D3](http://d3js.org), a Javascript library for data visualization. It reads my tsv files, allows some cool displays like a dynamically sorted bar chart of my App Store sales numbers, and it’s all client-side instead of server-side. I’m still learning the features - on pie chart coming up!
