Ever since it’s turned into a regular thing a few months ago, I’ve been meaning to check out Huntington Beach’s [Surf City Nights](http://www.surfcityusa.com/california-vacation-ideas/events/detail.aspx?id=4), the Tuesdays when [Main Street](http://www.beachcalifornia.com/mainst.html) is blocked off converted into a small street fair. I found it’s no [Third Street Promenade](http://thirdstreetpromenade.org/visitors/index.html) (I didn’t have to worry about finding parking), but it’s a nice change from the strip malls.
