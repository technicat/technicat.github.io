<p>After gallivanting in Hong Kong and New York/New Jersey the past year, I&rsquo;ve returned to the California and got what remains of my stuff out of storage. Starting with my Cylons (awesome geek gift from my <a href="http://amychu.com/">comic book author</a> sister). If some of their gaits seem odd, well, I packed in a hurry, and a little superglue surgery was required.</p>
