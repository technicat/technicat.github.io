The lazy man’s blog - post links (not even an embedded video!)

First, the Hudson Institute Conference on [A&nbsp; look at the 200-Ship Navy](http://www.c-span.org/Watch/Media/2009/05/22/HP/A/19029/Hudson+Institute+Conference+on+A+Look+at+a+200Ship+Navy.aspx) is the most interesting thing I’ve seen on C-Span 2, and I say that without sarcasm. I missed the first part, but the presentation by former Secretary of the Navy Don Lehman (Reagan administration) kept me up til almost three in the morning. He was sharp, witty, and blunt, pointing out the perils of bureacracy of bureacracy and feature creep, but maintaining that strong leadership could overcome it and it was up to the Navy to get it’s act together, get control of feature creep and install competition in procurement, restore it’s credibility, and tell Congress and the President and the Secretary of Defense what it needed. That all sounds abstract, but his elaboration on the particulars were entertaining and engrossing. For example, he thought the Navy needed more ships, but he wouldn’t go to Congress right now and ask for more money because the way things are now, that money would go down the drain. He pointed out that the current “fly-off” competition for new systems are useless because then a single supplier is selected, and only in the world of the Pentagon is no competition considered a good thing. And he mad an interesting comment on China - first he said, regarding the current capability of the Navy, that he wasn’t sure in a conflict with China over Taiwan that our carriers would make it out of there intact. Later, he opined that there was no ideological or political reason to ever go to war with China, but when war colleges on both sides start hypothesizing and planning for these scenarios, they can be self-fulfilling prophecies, citing the build-up to war with Japan in World War II.

On the lighter side, here’s an [article on rooster sauce](http://www.nytimes.com/glogin?URI=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/20/dining/20united.html&OQ=_rQ3D2Q26pagewantedQ3D1Q26sqQ3DsrirachaQ26stQ3DcseQ26scpQ3D1&OP=63d2ae1eQ2FC4Q3FECDQ60Q5C5mQ60Q60agCgUUQ3CCUeCgUCDQ7BQ7DQ7BQ7DBCgU-Q7DQ7BaQ3FD_YaoV).
