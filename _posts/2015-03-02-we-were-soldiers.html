My rating: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/17848327">4 of 5 stars</a><br/><br/>
This is one of the most memorable war books I&rsquo;ve read, up there with Band of Brothers. It&rsquo;s told in a matter-of-fact manner, but somehow that makes the bravery and suffering described in this narration even more stark. And yet the single moment that lingers in my memory of this book is the general making the battle-weary soldiers stand in the rain with their food while commending them on what a good job they did. Makes you wonder who the real enemy is.
