<p><em>Originally written on Epinions in June 2004:</em></p>

<p>I interviewed at <strong>iRobot</strong> several years ago when it was an MIT spinoff under a different name, based on Professor Rodney Brook&rsquo;s AI Lab robotics research (you may have seen the insect robots in the <strong>X-Files</strong> episode with the scientist named Bambi, or the documentary <strong>Fast, Cheap, and Out of Control</strong>). Who knows if they would have hired me, but since Netscape had just IPO&rsquo;d, I wanted to get into the commercial sector, so I went a different direction (literally, to the West Coast).</p>

<p>Now, after experimenting with putting their technology into toys, iRobot is a player in the commercial world with their <strong>Roomba</strong> line of robotic vacuum cleaners (available in The Sharper Image - how much more retail can you get?) that ostensibly do their job autonomously while you sit around, drink beer, and watch the game on TV. Forget planetary research - along with the new company name, this is brilliant marketing. It&rsquo;s probably too late to ask for a job with them again, but I couldn&rsquo;t resist buying a <strong>Roomba Pro</strong> for my own &ldquo;research&rdquo; purposes.</p>

<p>And research it is - I&rsquo;ve spent hours just watching this overgrown frisbee on wheels trundle around, trying to discern its pattern (according to the manual, it will first travel in a spiral, then find a wall, then criss-cross), and keeping it out of trouble by clearing its path and moving it back to a safe location when it gets stuck. It&rsquo;s like watching a toddler learn to walk, except this toddler doesn&rsquo;t really learn to stay out of trouble. In particular, I have verified Roomba&rsquo;s documented problems with rug fringes (they get tangled up in the spinning brush underneath) and low-incline obstacles like my exercise mats (the Roomba loses traction when one side is tilted up and gets stuck, turtle-like).</p>

<p>The Roomba is not a total wimp. You don&rsquo;t really have to monitor it constantly - the Roomba is not as loud as a powerful upright, but you definitely know when it&rsquo;s on, and it will turn off and emit a sad beep if it has a problem and a happy tune when it&rsquo;s done. My condo doesn&rsquo;t have stairs, but the Roomba&rsquo;s advertised step-avoidance feature does keep it from going off a rug once it&rsquo;s on (most of the time), and it pushes my wastebaskets around like a sumo wrestler. The Roomba is advertised to be pet-safe, but it still freaks out my cat.</p>

<p>Each cleaning session is for one rectangular area, begun simply by pressing the large S (10'x10&rsquo;), M (12'x12&rsquo;), or L (15'x15&rsquo;) buttons on top, so effective Roomba usage requires closing each door to a room or using one or both of the supplied battery-powered &ldquo;invisible wall&rdquo; units that look like high-tech doorstops and emit infrared beams detectable by the Roomba. They&rsquo;re easy to operate - place them so as to cordon off the exits and problematic areas of your room, press the On buttons, and they will automatically power off two hours later. The Roomba does seem to acquire a memory of its surroundings during each cleaning session - I&rsquo;ve moved some obstacles after the Roomba bumped into them, and the Roomba still avoided those areas afterwards, so to cover them I&rsquo;ve had to reset the Roomba by powering off and restarting.</p>

<p>The Roomba does an OK job on my low-pile carpet and seems to perform best on hard surfaces, like my kitchen and bath areas. The place where it shone was underneath my bed - it cleaned up the two years of cat hair that had accumulated there. It also did a decent job on my patio, although I&rsquo;m not sure getting all that outside dirt into the sweeping brushes is a good idea.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m motivationally challenged to just start vacuuming in the first place, so I&rsquo;ve accomodated the maintenance recommendations only partway - I empty the pull-out dust bin after every vacuum session (it fills up pretty fast, apparently there&rsquo;s a lot of dust out there), but instead of removing the wire catch from under the brushes and unscrewing (Phillips screws) the entire brush for detachment and cleaning, I just pull clumps out of the brushes with my fingers without unscrewing anything. So far, that seems to be enough.</p>

<p>The rechargable battery is supposed to last 90 minutes - I&rsquo;ve run the Roomba through almost three consecutive Small cleaning cycles, of about twenty minutes each, before the battery runs out. Recharging takes several hours (I charge it overnight), so it would have been nice if the optional rapid charger was standard (I didn&rsquo;t know about it until I received promotional mail for the charger+spare-battery &ldquo;duo pack&rdquo;.) The optional accessories are listed on the roombavac.com web site along with a pretty helpful FAQ and product comparison.</p>

<p>The Roomba Pro isn&rsquo;t much different from the Roomba, except for the spot cleaning mode which directs it to spiral around one spot on the floor. This mode only runs for a few minutes, so I don&rsquo;t bother with it. Some features I would like are available in the Roomba Elite - a multi-room cleaning mode, a &ldquo;Max&rdquo; cleaning mode that runs until the battery is depleted, and a remote control to direct the Roomba to where you want. Then I could really stay on the couch.</p>
