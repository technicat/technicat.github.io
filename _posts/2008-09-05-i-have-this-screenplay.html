<p>Well, back to blogging after skipping a few days. I spent Labor Day weekend and the days since trying to finish the screenplay I&rsquo;ve been talking about for three years in time for the <a href="http://www.zoetrope.com/contests/">Zoetrope screenplay contest</a>.</p>

<p>I wrote twenty pages and probably need at least another twenty to thirty. Which goes to show that a hard deadline helps, but I still can&rsquo;t write half a screenplay in a week. Conveniently providing an excuse, I saw that <a href="http://moviebytes.com/">MovieBytes</a> has a low satisfaction rating of the Zoetrope contest and higher ratings among the many others in its comprehensive listing. So I&rsquo;ll just target the next contest. And then the next one (just like repeated crunch times in the game industry - yeah, that works)</p>

<p>In the process, I&rsquo;ve found MovieBytes useful - it&rsquo;s not the prettiest site (it&rsquo;s got that 90&rsquo;s look), but it features some useful articles (like one that highly recommended entering contests just so you finish something) and a forum with members discussing topics like good screenwriting blogs, like <a href="http://mysterymanonfilm.blogspot.com/">Mystery Man on Film</a>.</p>

<p>I started my screenwriting projects (I actually have three in progress) after starting my ideas as short stories, then novels, and then after watching the spate of low-budget stilted-dialogue robotically-acted movies on the<a href="http://www.scifi.com/"> SciFi channel</a>, decided I can&rsquo;t do any worse. In other words, I figured it was a lower form of writing, especially after reading formulaic how-to guides like <a href="http://lewhunter.com/">Lew Hunter&rsquo;s screenwriting book</a> (I know he&rsquo;s famous and teaches well-known courses, but I like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._Michael_Straczynski">Michael J. Straczynsky&rsquo;s</a> book much more) and horror stories from screenwriters like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Goldman">William Goldman</a>. (Not that it&rsquo;s the worst form of prose - there&rsquo;s writing for video games, but then someone actually has to make the game. And of course there&rsquo;s blogging&hellip;.)</p>

<p>But lower literary standards and a desire to meet Hollywood actresses is only part of the story. I probably wouldn&rsquo;t attempt a screenplay without modern screenwriting software. Short stories are one thing - I must have written my first one in grade school on paper (I saw another student ably use metaphors, and copied that techique with gusto, thus my first case of style plagiarism) and wrote one for a <a href="http://ocw.mit.edu/OcwWeb/Writing-and-Humanistic-Studies/21W-755Fall-2006/CourseHome/">short story course</a> in college on a <a href="http://smbx.org/">Symbolics Lisp Machine</a> in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zmacs">ZEmacs</a> (hey, it was <a href="http://www.mit.edu/">MIT</a> - I just wish I&rsquo;d taken a course with <a href="http://web.mit.edu/m-i-t/science_fiction/profiles/haldeman.html">Joe Haldeman</a>).</p>

<p>But when I more recently tried to write longer, I lost a sense of structure. I&rsquo;ve been able to write essays on software since I can visualize the sequence and nesting of sections and subsections (and it helps that I write using an XML schema - I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;d like writing in Word) The segmentation into scenes in screenplays help (and I started write an XML schema for screenplays but didn&rsquo;t know enough of the domain to follow through). Alas, screenplay software typically requires memorization of hotkeys in order to write seamlessly (same problem I have computer graphics program like<a href="http://www.blender.org/"> Blender</a>). I think I had too much trouble with <a href="http://www.screenplay.com/">MovieMagic</a>, did OK with <a href="http://finaldraft.com/">Final Draft</a>, but now I&rsquo;m using the Mac-only product Montage. It&rsquo;s flakey (Montage often overwrites my character names with its autocompletion and gets stuck on some weird modes where I can&rsquo;t type or it inserts new blank sections), but the Outline feature that lets me list and rearrange scenes just by dragging is really the winning feature (seems that Mac-only apps have a leg up with drag-and-drop). In fact, my current strategy even for stories that might be novels is to start them out in Montage so I can restructure easily. The vendor, <a href="http://www.marinersoftware.com/">Mariner Software</a>, also has a StoryMill product for novels but I don&rsquo;t see the point in having both if they don&rsquo;t interoperate.</p>

<p>But in the meantime, I&rsquo;m back to slumming in the blogosphere (again, after all these years I&rsquo;m probably doing it now largely due to the good user interfaces like <a href="http://www.wordpress.org/">WordPress</a>). At least I&rsquo;m not using <a href="http://www.twitter.com/">Twitter</a>&hellip;</p>
