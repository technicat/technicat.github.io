<p>Analytics always sounded boring to me, but the Unity integration of gameanalytics.com is just awesome. You can visualize how people are playing your game right in the Unity Editor. For example, here&rsquo;s just a few days of tracked bowling ball movement in the HyperBowl San Francisco lane (with more data, I expect to see smoother paths and more variation in color-coded frequency).</p>

<p>I was wondering why people are rolling to the right at the first intersection and to the left at the last one, until someone pointed out to me that it must be the trolleys knocking the balls. The red spot indicating 100% frequency is where the ball starts, and the orange behind it indicates a lot of people are rolling backwards before rolling forwards. Interesting&hellip;</p>

<p>The recorded points are 3D positions, so the side view is also instructive. Here I can see a few players ran into the fire hydrant and got a boost.</p>

And speaking of boosts, the side view of the Rome lane shows players are regular getting launched by the flowers. Pretty!</p>
