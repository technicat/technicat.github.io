<p>One of my travel goals is to visit places I remember from Bugs Bunny episodes, mainly Albuquerque and Pismo Beach.</p>



<p>I did ABQ a while ago, and Pismo Beach over the recent holidays. You can get a hotel room facing the ocean - I wish I could bottle that air (and import it to Hong Kong).</p>

<p>Pismo Beach by the way includes Shell Beach, which should be of interest to Dark City fans.</p>
