It’s not easy to make money off books (I read that JK Rowling’s new book sold only 1500 copies since April, before it was revealed she’s the author, and the ebook for Shutter Island sells a handful a day). But self-publishing books is fun and painless compared to apps. The online tools are getting better. Barnes and Noble’s nookpress site now lets you edit your manuscript online, even allowing collaborators and commenters. And the Kindle Direct Publishing site has a Cover Creator for designing book covers. You can start with stock graphics in a variety of styles:

Or upload your own graphic and apply those styles. I think my final result looks pretty good:
