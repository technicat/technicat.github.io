Unity Analytics is in closed beta, but it’s pretty much open to anyone who’s got a Unity mobile app out there. I’m not using the more advanced features (funnels), but it’s handy enough I take a quick look at it every day at the graphs showing new users and current usage, and occasionally compare, for example, iOS vs. Android usage.
