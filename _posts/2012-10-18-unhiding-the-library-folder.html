<p>If I had Apple stock to sell, I would sell it, not because of important issues like worker exploitation in China or abuse of the patent system, but because they&rsquo;re doing stupid things like hiding the Library folder. It&rsquo;s a real pain in the ass, for example, when I&rsquo;m trying to access screenshots taken in Xcode. Typing the following in Terminal will undo the damage:</p>

<p><code>chflags nohidden ~/Library</code></p>
