Since the Unity Enhancement Pack photo picker seemed to liven up my [Fugu Maze](http://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=295808255&mt=8) app, I decided to also add it to [Fugu Tilt](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/fugutilt/id295241739?mt=8).

As with Fugu Maze, the photo picker is invoked with a double-tap. I also tweaked the screen-swipe controls so that a horizontal sweep rotates the tilt table, which is closer to the mouse controls of the web player and widget. And I added reflective water from the Unity iPhone Standard Assets and some background ocean sound. Unfortunately, it drowns out the original bouncing sounds, so Iâ€™ll have to look for some more pronounced sfx to add later.
