<p>A while ago, I was discussing how Unity follows standard user interface practices by making all operations available on the menu bar, even operations with keyboard shortcuts (and that&rsquo;s why they&rsquo;re called &ldquo;shortcuts&rdquo;). And you can always find those shortcuts listed by their corresponding menu bar items.</p>

<p>But to tell you the truth, Apple doesn&rsquo;t even follow that &ldquo;standard&rdquo; practice. I wish they did. Until now, I didn&rsquo;t realize you can rename a file or folder on the Mac by selecting the file and hitting Return (I really don&rsquo;t find that intuitive - sure you hit Return to finish renaming a file, but to start?). I&rsquo;ve been using the other method, selecting the file and then clicking on the filename, which is drives me crazy since half the time that gets interpreted as a double-click and opens the file or folder.</p>

<p>There should be a Rename operation in the right-click context menu or in the File menu, especially since it&rsquo;s one of the most common file operations. C'mon people, this isn&rsquo;t Blender. As it is, I had to google for how to rename a Mac file. I find myself resorting to google more and more to figure out how to use a Mac (and hey, the fact that the stuff I&rsquo;m looking for is posted on blogs and forums indicates I&rsquo;m not the only confused). There&rsquo;s something just wrong with that.</p>
