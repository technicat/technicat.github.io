<p>Signing up for one of those affiliate programs has been on my checklist for a while, ever since I read a blog by Noel Llopis recommending that as a way to augment App Store sales. I think I looked into it twice, but for some reason haven&rsquo;t followed through - I think there was something in the Linkshare signup that I didn&rsquo;t quite like or understand.</p>

<p>In any case, I read Cory Doctorow&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1616960485/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=httptechncom-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=1616960485">Context</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=httptechncom-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=1616960485" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important;margin:0px !important"/>, recently, and saw he does the same thing in his book reviews, with Amazon&rsquo;s affiliate program. It strikes me as a big dodgy (I&rsquo;m not an Anglophile, but some British words are just perfect, like &ldquo;bollocks&rdquo;) to review books and also profit off their sales. And Amazon always has some unnecessarily weird legalese in their programs. For example, I&rsquo;m not sure I&rsquo;m allowed to write this blog.</p>

<p>However, if it&rsquo;s good enough for Cory Doctorow, it&rsquo;s good enough for me. And Amazon&rsquo;s affiliate program does pay better than others. So let&rsquo;s give it a try (and maybe it&rsquo;s time I checked out that LinkShare program again) By the way, my memory of the book has faded enough that I can&rsquo;t give it a thorough review, but I recall giving it 3 out of 5 stars on Goodreads. I most liked his tips on writing (write a page a day) and self-publishing, but didn&rsquo;t find all the essays (or blogs) quite as interesting, always a risk in a collection like this.</p>
