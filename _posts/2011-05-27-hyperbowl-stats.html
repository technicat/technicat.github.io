<p>When I worked on the original HyperBowl game ten years ago, one of the first things I did was implement an on-screen FPS display. It&rsquo;s deja vu all over again - in the most recent <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/hyperbowl/id344209253?mt=8">HyperBowl</a> update on the App Store, I added an FPS display option again, plus a display of various system information.</p>
