For this past December, I ran a charity promotion, promising to donate a dollar for every [HyperBowl iPhone/iPad](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/hyperbowl/id344209253?mt=8) sale to a Donors Choose project. Here are the monthly sales results, totaling 160 sales, so $160 has been donated to a [project requesting an iPad](http://www.donorschoose.org/donors/proposal.html?id=496979).

The revenue graph actually looks a bit different, since I ran a $.99 sale at the beginning of the month, which shows (not for the first time) that dropping the price increases the number of unit sales but not necessarily enough to compensate for the price drop.
