One drawback of year-round good weather here in Southern California is the year-round visitation of door-to-door salespeople. When I first moved here, it was a novelty to chat with a couple of teens sent out by their “church” to sell magazines. Over a decade later, it’s getting pretty old. In a fit of pique, after getting rousted off my sofa by representatives of the Orange County Register, I sent this email complaint (took a while - the complaint submission form didn’t work, so I had to try the direct email link, at the risk of ending up on a spam list).

> &nbsp;I know this complaint won’t have any effect, but please don’t send kids or young adults around knocking on doors pushing subscriptions, particularly in gated areas marked No Soliciting. Your representatives offered a free issue which would have been fine, but then they kept trying to get me to sign up for a subscription immediately - this is my day off after a long work week and I shouldn’t have to stand at my door repeatedly saying no and then getting a “you’re missing out, bud” at the end. This just guarantees that not only won’t I buy a subscription, I’ll make a point of not buying your paper off the rack. No wonder print journalism is dying.

To their credit, the OC Register responded the next day apologizing and saying they would forward my complaint to the head of contractor services. I’m sure they will then review their whole marketing strategy and it’s dependence on door-to-door salespeople (and consider why they share that space only with magazines and Girl Scout cookies), or perhaps institute a training program that inculcates ethical and courteous sales tactics. Or maybe not. I confess I fibbed a bit in my complaint for effect. I didn’t have a really long week, Saturday isn’t really my day off, and I stopped buying the OC Register years ago after all those telemarketing calls (besides, the LA Times is a much better paper). And the last delivery guy was arrested for peeping in my complex, so I’m not in a hurry to hire his replacement.
