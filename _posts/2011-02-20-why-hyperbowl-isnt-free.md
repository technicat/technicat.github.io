Actually, HyperBowl is free on as a [web player](http://hyperbowl3d.com/) and so are the three individually released lanes on the iPhone/iPad that I decided not to update, anymore (keeping them running on iOS 3.0 for those running first-gen devices or can’t/won’t upgrade for some othe reason).

However, I made a conscious decision to keep the full [HyperBowl app](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/hyperbowl/id344209253?mt=8) out of the free zone. I don’t like the idea of seeing ads on the HyperBowl screen, and if I switch to a model where you have to buy lanes through in-app purchasing, I’m sure that would be annoying to those who already bought the full app (Apple suggested implementing some kind of virtual credit system to transition existing owners to an in-app purchasing update, but that’s a you-gotta-be-kidding me idea). But the biggest reason I haven’t delved into free promotions (except for handing out promo codes, and even that I regret in some instances), is the disjunct between reviews of free apps vs. paid apps.

Here are the App Store ratings for HyperBowl:

and here are the ratings for the free [HyperBowl Rome](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/hyperbowl-rome/id335726584?mt=8) lane, which is one of the more popular lanes in HyperBowl:

You might attribute the more numerous one-star ratings of the free version to the ease of accidentally hitting one-star in the old system when Apple prompted you to rate during deletion. But the difference shows up in the written reviews, too. The most recent reviews of the full HyperBowl app are very complimentary:

The ones for HyperBowl Rome are mixed. One well thought-out review, and a one-star disgruntler who’s actually complaining about the paid app.

There are some sayings about how you shouldn’t care about what other people say, but I’ll admit it - I care. And while I don’t mind just throwing some stuff out there to see what sticks or because I personally happen to like an app, when it comes to properties that I’m licensing, like HyperBowl, I feel some obligation to try and protect the brand.
