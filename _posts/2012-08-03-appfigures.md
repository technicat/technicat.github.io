I saw tweets from[flarb](http://flarb.com/) about [appfigures](http://appfigures.com/) yesterday so I checked it out. The unique feature it has over AppViz and AppAnnie is support for some Android appstores - well, two of them, Google Play and the Amazon appstore. Now, it disturbs me that I have different total numbers reported by each of the three tools I’m now using, but setting that aside, it’s nice to be able to compare sales on different appstores.

Here are my total downloads and upgrades for a three-month period:

and here I’m graphing just my Android sales of [HyperBowl](http://hyperbowl3d.com/) Lite and can compare Google Play vs. Amazon:

Too bad they don’t have support for the Nook appstore - that would cover everything for me. But another unique feature they have is a REST API - that could replace the download stats I manually export and upload to my [Fugu Games site](http://fugugames.com/).
