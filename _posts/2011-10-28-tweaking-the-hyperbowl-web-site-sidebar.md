This isn’t as dramatic a makeover as my [Fugu Games](http://fugugames.com/) revision, but I decided to clean up the [HyperBowl](http://hyperbowl3d.com/) site a little bit, specifically the sidebar. I removed the Kongregate “Tip Me” badge (it makes me feel like I’m panhandling, and there’s no point in pointing from one web player page to another), moved the NOOK badge there (before, I had to scroll down to see it on my laptop screen), removed the Facebook Like button (I’d rather have people click on the Facebook fan page badge and Like me there), removed the Google PlusOne button (useless), and moved the Google ad up and into view (but more or less still out of the way). Baby steps!
