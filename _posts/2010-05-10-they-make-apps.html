<p>Courtesy of <a href="http://appboy.com/">AppBoy</a>, I discovered the app developer listing <a href="http://theymakeapps.com/">They Make Apps</a> last week. I added <a href="http://fugugames.com/">Fugu Games</a> and it was easy and free (with an option to pay for a more prominent display). You can list your rate rate in $5k quanta up to &ldquo;over $20k&rdquo;. I&rsquo;m relieved to see many developers aren&rsquo;t listing the minimum $5k - I&rsquo;m often approached by prospective clients who want an app developed without paying much or anything, and I was beginning to wonder&hellip;</p>

<p>I should also mention the site looks fantastic (I say enviously). Apparently standards based, as it looks fine on the iPad with just a slight glitch on the side tabs. Look Ma, no Flash!</p>
