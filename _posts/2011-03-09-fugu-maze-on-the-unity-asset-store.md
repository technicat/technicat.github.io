March is the month of monetization. I told myself I’d never use that word, but while I’m in between contracts, I do want to see if how much of a living I can make entirely off my own software projects. One channel I’m trying out is the Unity Asset Store - this week I placed my [Fugu Maze](http://u3d.as/content/technicat-llc/fugu-maze/1AT) project on it.

Actually, I had put up the Fugu Maze project for sale a few years ago after someone on the Unity forum PM’d me to ask for a complete example project (the key maze generation script was already on the Unify community wiki). So I took that opportunity to place it on Dreamhost’s Files Forever digital distribution system and that was a nightmare. The interface was so confusing, I ended up placing the project on my ftp site to complete the transaction. And I got a flurry of questions right after the sale, so I’m not sure it was worth the time.

The latter part still might be an issue (most questions I get on my free scripts are really about how to write new code, not how the existing code works), but the Unity Asset Store is pretty slick, and Fugu Maze was approved within a couple of hours (I submitted it and received the approval during one Starbucks session). In contract, HyperBowl just got into an in-review state on the Mac App Store three weeks after submission!
