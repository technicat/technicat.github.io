I finally got around to releasing an ad-free version of Fugu Maze on the Android Market, called [Fugu Maze Pro](https://market.android.com/details?id=com.technicat.FuguMazePro). The download stats still seem to be broken (for a week, now). The dashboard shows I already have more active users than downloads (and thatâ€™s zero percent?)
