Seriously, my nephews know all the popular games, more than I do, and they can get play through a lite version of a game faster than you can say “Lodsys”. I even gave them a Unity demo - showing them how I have HyperBowl in Unity and then showing them the running build on my iPad, and they actually exclaimed “Oh, cool!” nearly in unison. I can see the next Unity forum posting: “Seeking team of like-minded 4-8 year olds for an MMORPG project!”
