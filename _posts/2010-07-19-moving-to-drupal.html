<p>For a while, I stopped updating the <a href="http://technicat.com/">technicat</a> web site because, well, because I couldn&rsquo;t. After updating my Mac to Snow Leopard (forced to, because the latest XCode required it), I couldn&rsquo;t run <a href="http://forrest.apache.org/">Apache Forrest</a> anymore because that doesn&rsquo;t run on Java 6. I was leaning toward <a href="http://drupal.org/">Drupal</a> and finally committed to it this weekend. It involved some contortions - ultimately, I have <a href="http://technicat.com/">http://technicat.com/</a> redirecting to <a href="http://drupal.technicat.com/">http://drupal.technicat.com/</a> (and the old site is at <a href="http://forrest.technicat.com/">http://forrest.technicat.com/</a> )</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s more of a Drupal-for-Dummies setup, so I can&rsquo;t add plugins or themes, and I suspect there&rsquo;s something wrong with the installation or me, since I don&rsquo;t see some things that I think I should be seeing (like a Contact form and image upload options), but basically, it works, and I found a theme that doesn&rsquo;t look terrible. Now, I have to start updating the content&hellip;</p>
