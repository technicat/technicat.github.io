<p>I spotted the (supposedly) paid version of HyperBowl on one of the many &ldquo;free apk&rdquo; pages on Facebook, so I clicked on the &ldquo;intellectual property&rdquo; selection in the Report this Page option. I don&rsquo;t know why they bother even listing it, since this is all they offer (they don&rsquo;t even bother hiding under the DMCA like everyone else).</p>
