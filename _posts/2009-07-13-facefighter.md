I finally got around to trying [FaceFighter](http://www.appyfacefighter.com/), the second app from my friends at [Appy Entertainment](http://appyentertainment.com/)

![IMG_0028](http://itshardtofondlepenguins.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/IMG_0028.jpg "IMG\_0028")

It’s some good old-fashioned button-mashing fun (or maybe that’s just the way I play).

The Appy blog is generally quite entertaining, too, but, albeit on a more melancholy note, this [personal reminiscence of Michael Jackson](http://goldenboat.wordpress.com/2009/07/07/mj/) by Project Directory Emmanuel Valdez is worth a read.
