If I’d tried harder (or at all) in art class and learned something, anything about creating audio, I’d be all set as one-man game development shop, but I think I’m fortunate that the relevant skill I do have is programming.

- I can do builds whenever I want. I am the build master. As I have a bug fix or something new I want to try (and then the bug fix comes after that), I can publish immediately to the Android Market and submit immediately to any other app store. For non-programmers, it’s hard enough just explaining what’s involved in setting up an Apple developer account, much less generating a distribution build from an XCode project.
- I can find plenty of ready-to-use audio and art, e.g. on the Unity Asset Store. There’s also plenty of ready-to-modify code, but contrary to popular opinion, you’re headed for disappointment if you drop in code written by someone else and expect it to do exactly what you want.
- I can find plenty of artists and audio designers as potentially interested partners (and game designers and business people for that matter, but the last thing I need are more ideas and people with magic formulas for success). But just check the [Unity forums](http://forum.unity3d.com/index.php) and you’ll see how hard it is to attract good programmers without actually paying them (a non-pittance).
- I can port. Give me all the source assets for a game that used to run on something, and I can get it to run on something else. Take [HyperBowl](http://hyperbowl3d.com/). I updated the original code just enough so I could get it running just enough so I could write an exporter using the FBX SDK so I could import the original assets into Unity so I could script a new implementation of the game. All coding.
- I can debug. Reading and reasoning about code helps with&nbsp; that.
- I can report bugs. Ditto.
- I can figure out what’s possible. Will this work? I can read the doc and/or try it and find out. Sorry, this runs at 5fps.
- I can find decent-paying work when I come to the realization that my app revenue is not covering my expenses. That’s not quite as true for artists and audio designers. Sorry, life (or the video game industry) is not fair.
But artists and musicians can take comfort - we still envy you guys. I don’t expect to ever be in a “Programmer’s Alley” at E3 autographing printouts of my code.
