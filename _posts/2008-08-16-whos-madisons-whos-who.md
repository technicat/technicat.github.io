I guess I’m famous now, since I’ve received a couple of these emails:

> You were recently appointed as a biographical candidate to represent your industry in the Who’s Who Among Executives and Professionals, and for inclusion into the upcoming 2008-2009 “Honors Edition” of the registry. We are pleased to inform you that on July 9th, your candidacy was approved. Your confirmation for inclusion will be effective within five business days, pending our receipt of the enclosed application. The Office of the Managing Director appoints individuals based on a candidate’s current position, and usually with information obtained from researched executive and professional listings. The director thinks you may make an interesting biographical subject, as individual achievement is what Who’s Who is all about. Upon final confirmation you will be listed among thousands of accomplished individuals in the Who’s Who Registry. There is no cost to be included. We do require additional information to complete the selection process and kindly ask that you access this form on our website..

Oddly, the first email had “Final Notice” in the title and said I had five days to reply - then a few weeks later I got the second notice. And the emails didn’t bother to include a link to their web site, which doesn’t have the same domain as the email sender address, although you can get their after clicking on the [Lyris](http://www.lyris.com/) (direct-marketing) link. Notice that there’s no opt-out info in the letter contrary to the “best practices” listed in Lyris’s [white paper](http://www.lyris.com/resources/reports/deliverability_report_Q22006.pdf) claiming statistics for “false positives” in spam filters. So I did a little googling, first of all to find their [web site](http://www.madisonswhoswho.com/), which does exist and features a cheerful talking head describing Madison’s Who’s Who as “the world’s premier source for networking” (say, heard of [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/)?) and featuring such members as an assistant VP of Citibank an a real estate broker. Real exclusive. You can see only some of the Members of the Year and the VIP Members because the index links for those pages are only partly functional, but the ones who do appear have the dubious honor of being in the select club that might have opted for the paid membership mentioned in the FAQ. Prices aren’t listed, but some first-hand experiences are mentioned in the [Ripoff Report](http://www.ripoffreport.com/reports/0/187/ripoff0187077.htm) and a [Make Money Fast Hall of Humiliation thread](http://www.mmfhoh.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=3265&sid=a56ee5ca9f058a9e9afa94c6b711f0a1)Then again, I did update my listing in the [Johns Hopkins University Alumni Directory](http://alumni.jhu.edu/news_events/directory.htm), and that was basically the same thing - JHU contracted [Harris Connect](http://www.harrisconnect.com/) to send out emails to alumni asking for updated information, but the card I got just said to call a Harris Connect representative who tried to sell me the expensive version of the directory and, after I declined, offering a less expensive CD-ROM version of the directory that hadn’t even been mentioned in the JHU announcement or mailing. I shouldn’t have been surprised - I once signed up out of loyalty for one of the credit cards JHU was pushing (even with mass mailings signed by the university president) and was rewarded by those annoying telemarketing calls from the credit card company (MBNA, as I recall). Go, [Blue Jays](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johns_Hopkins_Blue_Jays)!
