<p>I finally picked up the Blue-Ray version of Firefly last weekend. It&rsquo;s basically the same as the DVD set, but more compact, of course, and includes a fun lunch round-table. It did remind me to update my list of shows that were ended aggravatingly early:
</p><ul><li>Firefly</li>
	<li>Deadwood</li>
	<li>Angel</li>
	<li>Dead Like Me</li>
	<li>Wolf Lake</li>
	<li>Now and Again</li>
	<li>Veronica Mars</li>
	<li>Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles</li>
</ul>
