I was content to use one of the presupplied themes for my [twitter account](http://twitter.com/fugugames), unti I saw a twitter profile page with a photo as the background. I thought, that’s lame, I can do a better job. After trying out various layouts that didn’t squash or stretch properly or blend nicely with the content area, I climbed back into my graphic design comfort zone and just used one of my beach photos.
