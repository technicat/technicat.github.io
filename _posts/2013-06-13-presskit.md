I killed a day playing around with [presskit()](http://dopresskit.com/), a free press kit web template. I created a page for [HyperBowl](http://presskit.hyperbowl3d.com/), and I think it looks alright. The installation is pretty easy - download the zip file, unzip to get just one file, install.php, which you upload to a web site (that supports PHP of course), visit that page on the site and follow the instructions, which mostly involve click-to-continue and uploading banner and (optionally) logo and icon images along with any number of other images, and editing then renaming the generated data.xml file with your press kit contents.

There are a couple of quirks. Extra images don’t display completely unless you can get just the right aspect ratio, and I don’t see a way to remove the Projects header. And the optional Projects are essentially other presskit() pages in a subdirectory. It would be nice to have them on other web sites, so I could have one for each project and a master one on my company site.

But still, it’s better than something I would have put together from scratch, and I’m tempted to see if I can use it for a resume.
