<p>The <a href="http://itunes.com/app/hyperbowlrome">HyperBowl Rome</a> 1.1 update is on the App Store - approved in less than a week!</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s interesting to see the App Store now automatically lists the &ldquo;Updated&rdquo; date. So, thankfully, no more trying to game the system by manually adjusting the Release date with each update. It&rsquo;s also interesting to see the Update date is actually tomorrow. That should address another problem - I used to set the Release date as soon as I got the app approval notice, but then it would be buried by all the app that already showed up that day. Maybe this will give it a little more visibility. Still, there&rsquo;s not much visibility overall to recent updates/releases, unless you score a New and Noteworthy listing by Apple. One can hope.</p>
