Word Lens is the coolest AR app I’ve seen. Place your camera over some text, and it not only translates the text but replaces the original words with the translations. One fun trick I accidentally found - if you choose an incorrect source language, e.g., when I attempted to use Russian-\>English over English text, the system flails and flickers random translations. It’s like looking at subliminal messages.
