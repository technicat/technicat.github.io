I joined my homeowners association board this year, and while I don’t want to overstate my contributions of the last two months, that time has vindicated my apathy of previous years. Living in a condo near the beach is sort of like being on vacation every day (imagine The Dude in The Big Lebowski) But frankly, you can lose sleep over all the issues of maintaining a condo complex (the point in getting a condo instead of a house was to avoid all that), dealing with disputes and lawsuits, and maintaining the chronically (but not atypically) underfunded association accounts, made more difficult with the recession and spate of foreclosures.

One thing that I’ve learned to my surprise, now that I’ve had to wake up and smell the coffee, when banks foreclose on a home, they don’t pay any of the monthly association dues until they sell the place, which can take months, even more than a year. Now, it’s bad enough when resident owners doesn’t pay the dues - unlike avoiding mortgage payments where you’re sticking it to the bank, here you’re sticking it to your neighbors. Now I find that banks are essentially absentee owners who don’t pay their dues (or pay any attention to all the other rules that all the other owners are supposed to follow). And these are the people who blamed dishonest home buyers for the recession (I’m not kidding, I heard Jaime Dimond say this in a speech on CNBC just when things were starting to fall apart) and cite “moral hazard” all the time when it comes to mortgage renegotiation or forgiveness. This disturbs my serenity, man. Which brings to mind an utterance from Malcolm Reynolds, which I’ll paraphrase - my days of not respecting banks is certainly coming to a middle.
