<p>I&rsquo;ve heard from more than one person that Hong Kong is too materialistic, and perhaps I got an inkling of that when I attended the Brand and Products Expo at Victoria Park. The name of the event should have been a clue - it was like walking into a giant infomercial with exercise machines, frying pans and rice cookers. But there was some good food, too (the reason I was urged to attend), like this heaping plate of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turnip_cake">lo bak go</a>, aka turnip cake aka radish cake aka Chinese radish cake. Basically, it&rsquo;s fried mush and possibly my favorite dim sum dish, but it&rsquo;s usually cut in flat squares and three to a plate. This was a pile of cubes, nicely fried on all sides and a bit spicy. Mmmm.</p>
