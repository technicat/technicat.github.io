<p>I learned to play politics at an early age. In junior high school, my English teacher addressed the class to praise me for pointing out one of her errors to her personally rather than embarrassing her in front of class. (This, and other lessons like Blame the Latino Student, will be in my next book, Everything I Needed to Know in Life I Didn&rsquo;t Learn in School).</p>

<p>And that indeed has been a recurring theme in my adult years. For example,  when the management company for my condo sent me a letter saying I&rsquo;d be fined for not attending the next HOA meeting and I said basically what the hell is this on the HOA facebook page, the management company complained that it was just a mistake and I should have talked to them first (basically, why didn&rsquo;t you just call us after we sent you a threatening letter?)</p>

<p>In a broader scope, some companies feel compelled to preemptively dissuade you from complaining to the press. When Dreamhost ran their app contest (the web-hosted kind), they said in their blog don&rsquo;t go whining to the press, it&rsquo;s beneath you, or something like that. Never mind that an earlier blog complained about how Apple unfairly rejected one of their apps (the mobile kind).</p>

<p>And  speaking of Apple, whose admonition to not go running to the press after an app rejection has more of a veiled that&rsquo;s-not-going-to-help threatening tone. Now, come on. That&rsquo;s just un-American. The right to complain to anyone who will listen is in our Bill of Rights. Compare that to China, where if you complain about the wrong thing with the wrong people, you can start complaining about prison conditions.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m no stranger to bad reviews, but I don&rsquo;t include &ldquo;please don&rsquo;t give me a bad review - talk to me first&rdquo; in all my App Store descriptions (if Apple is anti-complaint, they should automatically include that, or disable 1 and 2-star ratings). Some developers do include please-don&rsquo;t-1-star-me appeals, and it sounds whiny and insecure. Don&rsquo;t be like my junior high English teacher or Apple. It&rsquo;s beneath you.</p>
