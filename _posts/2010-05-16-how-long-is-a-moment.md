I recently ran an installer that said “This might take a moment.” Which led me to wonder, how long is a moment? And if it doesn’t take a moment, that means it’s instantaneous? I’ve see some other programs (and burueacracies) say “This will take a few moments”, which seems to indicate a moments are fixed quanta of time. I’ve never seen anyone (or thing) say, “This will take several moments” or “This will take lots and lots of moments”, so based on experience watching progress indicators on the screen, you might think that a moment is actually a long time. But I checked the online Merriam-Webster dictionary, which supplies “a minute portion of time” or “a comparatively brief period of time”. So a lawyerly interpretation of “this might take a moment” could actually be “this could take a little time, if you’re lucky”.
