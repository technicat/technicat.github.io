Apple provides daily and weekly download stats for your apps on the [App Store](http://www.apple.com/iphone/appstore/) in the form of plain text files. But you don’t need to wrangle them into a spreadsheet program - the handy [Appstore Clerk](http://blog.fieryferret.com/2008/10/appstore-clerk.html) presents a simple tally.

I only bother downloading the weekly reports. This app shown above was fairly popular in its first week, but then after I started charging for it, the download rate dropped dramatically. The upgrade figures spike whenever I release a new version, and the handful of weekly new buyers perked up a bit during the holidays.

This next app wasn’t as initially popular, and in my own opinion was less polished, so I kept it free. As can be seen from all the zeroes in the update column, I haven’t released a new version (until just recently), and it also had a declining download rate, but didn’t diminish as much as I expected. I was also surprised by the uptick during the holidays. Hmm, maybe that one has more potential than I thought…
