I was googling around for mentions of my apps the other day and found [FuguTilt](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/fugutilt/id295241739?mt=8) listed on an App Store Top 500 list on [AppAnnie](http://appannie.com/). For the Games category. In the Action subcategory. In China. OK, it’s pretty specific, and looks like it’s dropped off already, but I’ll take it.

Anyway, that prompted me to try out the App Annie service, which is another web-based app stats tracker and is currently in beta and thus free. I’m pretty happy with [AppViz](http://appviz.com/) for checking my daily sales stats, especially since it doesn’t require a subscription fee, but it is cumbersome for tracking app rankings - I have to manually enter all the apps and specific categories and subcategories I’m interested in, (with two subcategories and iPad support, that’s four entries for [HyperBowl](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/hyperbowl/id344209253?mt=8), not counting more general tracking like “All Games” and “Top Grossing”). The resulting graph is not too readable, either, although maybe it’ll get more interesting as I collect more data.

The App Annie ranking display is much more convenient:

And there’s an export-to-file button for the graph:

One AppViz feature it’d be nice to have here is the display of all my app rankings in one graph. And my AppAnnie graphs are a bit sparse because it just has the latest data from the App Store. I wish I could import from my AppViz data.

The AppAnnie reviews display is also pretty nice. AppViz has a decent reviews display but only shows the average rating. App Annie is like the App Store in that it shows the breakdown of ratings, and a nice feel-good feature is the ability to filter the results. Here, I’m just looking at the “favorable” reviews for HyperBowl.
