The developer Q&A in the Blue Mars city Tharsis last night was the largest I’ve attended. And busy. It started off as usual with some small talk (pictured here) and then a torrent of questions. I had trouble keeping up with the scrolling chat box! I think you’ll agree these are good-looking avatars (except me, wearing the short shorts and t-shirt)
