My first thought upon seeing the HK Weather app was why have a weather app for just once location? But now it’s one of my daily-used iPad apps. For one, it looks good and it provides a quick way to check the weather, without even going to the trouble of selecting my location as I would in a regular weather app. But also there is weather data specific to this location, like the color-coded thunderstorm warnings.

Another thing I like is the not-in-your-face placement of the rate-this-app option, right next to the report-a-problem option.

One thing I’d like to see in this app is the air quality level, which is also color-coded - if the thundestorm warning is black and the air quality is brown, it’s the apocalypse.
