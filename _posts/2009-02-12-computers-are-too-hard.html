<p>If you want to figure out what&rsquo;s wrong with computers these days, you don&rsquo;t have to slog through all those books on user engineering and cognitive science. Just tell your neighbors you work on computers, and they&rsquo;ll come knocking on your door with &ldquo;a problem that will take just a few minutes&rdquo;. Aside from the realization that I don&rsquo;t have the patience to make the Geek Squad, I&rsquo;ve learned a few things:
</p><ul><li>People don&rsquo;t understand hierarchical file systems. That&rsquo;s why all the new ones have search boxes. But that&rsquo;s still a last resort. I know some highly-paid professionals who would be lost without the Most Recent file menu item in their application. And file systems are getting so big, I confess I&rsquo;m relying on that more and more.</li>
	<li>Apple came up with some nifty ideas in the first Mac, but double-clicking was not one of them. Try explaining to someone they can double-click an executable icon or name on the desktop to run it, but only single-click on an icon that is a button and only single-click anywhere in a web browser or any window that happens to be a web browser or behave like a web browser (e.g. a help window) and by the way on a Mac don&rsquo;t double-click any icon on the Dock.</li>
	<li>Another mouse problem - dragging. When you drag a file, are you copying or moving it? Depends. To save a lengthy explanation that might turn out to be wrong, I just say, &ldquo;right-click, select Copy, right-click, select Paste&rdquo;.</li>
	<li>No one knows what an operating system is. It&rsquo;s like saying &ldquo;semiconductor&rdquo; - users know their computers are full of it but wouldn&rsquo;t be able to define it to save their lives. Besides, they don&rsquo;t really care. Part of the problem is that all Microsoft products are named &ldquo;Microsoft&rdquo; - one neighbor told me she had an older version of Windows and then handed me Microsoft Office.</li>
	<li>We&rsquo;re conditioned to expect every upgrade to require upgrading everything else. One neighbor wanted help in upgrading her printer driver to work with Vista. Turns out the printer already worked fine - she just assumed it wouldn&rsquo;t.</li>
</ul>
