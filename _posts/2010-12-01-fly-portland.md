Portland topped a recent Zagat poll of favorite airports, and I’m with the general public on this one. It’s a spacious, fairly attractive and well-kept (sounds like I’m talking about a blind date), and features a couple of Powell’s bookstores (probably the best sci-fi selection you’ll find in an airport). The free wi-fi service performed better than the one I’d paid $9.95/day for at my hotel, and sports a nifty home page that even indicates your location in the airport.

But most important are first impressions. When I checked in, I was planning to use the automated kiosk, but the Jet Blue ticketing agent beckoned to me. Based on my previous experience at JFK, I figured she’d give me the evil eye, mark my ticket so I’d get a pat-down (and I wasn’t looking forward to the new shouldn’t-you-buy-me-dinner-first frisking), but she was friendly, printed my boarding pass even faster than the kiosk would have, and not only did I not get groped by the screeners, they were friendly and courteous. After a few “How are you today?”, “Thank you” and “Have a great flight"s, I’m almost ready to submit to a cavity search. Too bad I have to travel to Portland to fly the friendly skies.
