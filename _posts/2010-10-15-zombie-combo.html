<p>You can&rsquo;t go wrong with zombies. I recently picked up Appy Entertainment&rsquo;s $.99 zombie app package. My only complaint is that I can&rsquo;t remember the name - Zombie in a Box? All-in-one Zombie Box? Zombie Bento Box? (Wait, I should have kept that name for myself).</p>

<p>Turns out I had three of the included apps, already, but that still left several more that I hadn&rsquo;t seen before, such as this build-our-yown-zombie-head app.</p>
