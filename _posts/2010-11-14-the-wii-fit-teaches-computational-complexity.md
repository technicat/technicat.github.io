I was performing my morning Wii Fit workout, playing the cycling game, when I realized the game goal, finding the shortest route to collect all the flags, was the [Traveling Salesman Problem](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem). The TSP is the most famous [NP-Complete problem](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_NP-complete_problems) and was kind of fashionable back around the time I graduated from college. You could easily find the book by [Garey and Johnson](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computers_and_Intractability:_A_Guide_to_the_Theory_of_NP-Completeness), and there was even a sly reference to the fundamental question P=NP in a [Simpsons](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treehouse_of_Horror_VI)and [Futurama](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futurama) episodes.

I recall at my first job, working on automated VLSI design software, one of my coworkers often exclaimed upon seeing any non-trivial problem was to exclaim “that’s the traveling salesman problem!” That, of course, was silly, but it’s silliness with ambition (if you solve the question whether P=NP, you’ve got a lock on the Turing Award) These days, instead of computational complexity and algorithms, I hear about design patterns instead - “That’s a singleton! That’s a factory pattern!” More correct, but less interesting. I miss the TSP.
