Christmas came early for me this year. After getting my first new car in nineteen years, I’m still figuring out all the new technology features. My previous car didn’t even have power locks or windows. Or quite as much plastic. The most fun new feature for me is the iPod connection. Here I’m playing the Concrete Scrapbook album from my friend Michelle Krell (available on iTunes - support your indie musician!)
