Early this year, I decided I couldnâ€™t procrastinate on getting a professional-quality pause menu and after some dithering, chose the UnityGUI-based GUIKIT001 over EZGUI because it looked like I could get going faster with it. And I think I was correct - once I customized it to my liking, it was fairly easy to copy the setup to all my apps. But I ran into some UnityGUI text corruption issues on the NOOK Color with [Fugu Maze](http://search.barnesandnoble.com/books/e/2940043858689?itm=1&usri=Technicat2C%2BLlc) (and to a lesser extent, [HyperBowl](http://search.barnesandnoble.com/HyperBowl/Technicat-LLC/e/2940043856555?itm=2&usri=Technicat2C%2BLlc)), so I felt compelled to move to EZGUI, finally. It is indeed a more complex system, but I managed to get Fugu Maze switched over in a couple of days by starting with the pause menu from one of the included demos:
