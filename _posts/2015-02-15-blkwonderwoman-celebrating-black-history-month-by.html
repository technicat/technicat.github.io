Butler was born on June 22, 1947, in Pasadena, California. She studied at several universities and began her writing career in the 1970s. Her books blended elements of science fiction and African 
American spiritualism. Her first novel, Patternmaster (1976), 
would ultimately become one of the installments in the four-volume 
Patternist series. Butler went on to write several other novels, 
including Kindred (1979) as well as Parable of the Sower (1993) and Parable of the Talents (1998), of the Parable series. She continued to write and publish until her death on February 24, 2006, in Seattle, Washington.<br/><br/>In 1995, Butler received a “genius” grant from the MacArthur 
Foundation—becoming the first science-fiction writer to do so—which 
allowed her to buy a house for her mother and herself.<br/></p></blockquote>
