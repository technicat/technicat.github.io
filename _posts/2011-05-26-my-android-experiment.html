<p>I&rsquo;ve been thinking about when to take the Android plunge ever since Unity Android was in its first beta. After trying to come up with a business case for it, I just decided I felt like it. I mean, the big win in Unity is the cross-platform deployment, and I really wanted to see my apps on my Samsung Vibrant. And that rationale was validated - after figuring out the Android Market publication process with some AppMakr-based apps, I started with my simple iOS apps, <a href="https://market.android.com/details?id=com.technicat.WordsEyeFeature">WordsEye Feature</a>, the orphaned <a href="https://market.android.com/details?id=com.technicat.ElektraDance">Elektra Dance</a> (due to various implicit and explicit App Store review criteria, I can&rsquo;t update it on the App Store, anymore), the critically unacclaimed but highly downloaded <a href="https://market.android.com/details?id=com.technicat.FuguBowl">Fugu Bowl</a> (gets me a few bucks a day in iAd revenue), then <a href="https://market.android.com/details?id=com.technicat.FuguMaze">Fugu Maze</a> (sort of has a cult following) and finally <a href="https://market.android.com/details?id=com.technicat.HyperBowl">HyperBowl</a> (the big one). All but HyperBowl were ported within a day each, and HyperBowl took perhaps five days, much of it spent tweaking for performance and manually converting the textures and audio that didn&rsquo;t get automatically converted the way I wanted.</p>

<p>Developing for Android is fun. It puts the self back in self-publishing. Upload, click the publish button, boom, it&rsquo;s there. You don&rsquo;t have to go through anything like the Apple approval process, and even the software development pipeline is less bureaucratic - you don&rsquo;t have to go through XCode.</p>

<p>The downside (aside from deploying an app that can&rsquo;t possibly be tested on all the Android devices out there) is that it&rsquo;s even harder to get people to buy Android apps than iOS apps. After seeing that Angry Birds went the all-ad route and Crazy Snowboard has over 250,000 ad-version downloads but less than 50 paid, it didn&rsquo;t seem worth it to even try fielding a paid Android app, but I gave it a shot, anyway. I put Fugu Maze up for a dollar - no takers after a week, so I made it free and it quickly became my most downloaded and best reviewed app. It&rsquo;s a good thing Unity provides an Admob plugin on their forum (and an even better thing that one Unity user posted step-by-step instructions on how to integrate it).</p>

<p>One discovery now that I&rsquo;ve reluctantly embraced an ad revenue model (yuck, I don&rsquo;t even like saying it), if you&rsquo;re going to go that way, it&rsquo;s better to design apps with that ad space in mind. I had a heck of a time shuffling UI elements around in HyperBowl to make room for a banner ad, and the front end navigation buttons are uncomfortably close to the ads.</p>

<p>It seems that Google almost discourages paid apps. Once you make an app free, you can&rsquo;t change it back to a paid app. And unlike on the App Store, you can&rsquo;t buy a paid app you put on the Android Market, so you can&rsquo;t test the version that&rsquo;s up there or the payment/download process. But since there&rsquo;s no rule against having both free and paid versions of an Android app (Apple has been erratically clamping down on that), you can always change your mind and add a paid version. After publishing an Admob version of HyperBowl, I just really wanted to see a version without ads, so I went ahead and published an ad-free version titled <a href="https://market.android.com/details?id=com.technicat.HyperBowlPro">HyperBowl Pro</a>. It took little extra work (just copying the Unity project, undoing all the kludgy adjustments I&rsquo;d made to accomodate ads, rename, rebuild). It&rsquo;s better for screenshots and demos (it&rsquo;s great to just pull out my phone and start up the app in a spontaneous demo). And I was a little surprised that I got a few sales right after I published it. Maybe I&rsquo;ll go ahead and try a paid version of Fugu Maze, again.</p>
