<p>Although <a href="http://www.wired.com/gadgets/gadgetreviews/magazine/17-01/st_burningquestion">Wired</a> asserts fax is not only alive, but thriving, based on the number of multifunction printers sold, I seriously doubt it. I bet most use only two out of the three functions (I have a multifunction printer, and I don&rsquo;t even have  a land line).</p>

<p>And during the year I used <a href="http://efax.com/">eFax</a>, I received just one legitimate fax (from someone who couldn&rsquo;t find my email address), and only needed to send two - the first, not surprisingly, for my doctor&rsquo;s terribly inefficient and error-prone billing service (apparently they couldn&rsquo;t be bothered to call up my insurer themselves), and the second, more surprisingly, to the <a href="http://developer.apple.com/iPhone/program/">Apple iPhone Developer Program</a>.</p>

<p>But the most telling evidence I&rsquo;ve seen that fax is on the decline is from eFax itself. The first time I tried eFax, I thought the customer service was excellent. This time around, they never bothered to update their Mac application to an Intel Mac version, at one point I couldn&rsquo;t even see a way to send faxes from their web site, and I received a regular stream of junk faxes, some from eFax (or it&rsquo;s parent company, JRD Communications) itself. Although I hadn&rsquo;t selected the automatic billing and renewal option listed on the web site, they went ahead and tried to charge my card again after a year  (once again, thank you, person-who-stole-my-credit-card-earlier-and-forced-me-to-change-it). When I emailed them to officially cancel, they replied I request cancellation via their on-line support chat system. Odd - shouldn&rsquo;t I be able to fax it in?</p>
