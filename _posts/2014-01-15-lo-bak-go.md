I’ve heard from more than one person that Hong Kong is too materialistic, and perhaps I got an inkling of that when I attended the Brand and Products Expo at Victoria Park. The name of the event should have been a clue - it was like walking into a giant infomercial with exercise machines, frying pans and rice cookers. But there was some good food, too (the reason I was urged to attend), like this heaping plate of [lo bak go](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turnip_cake), aka turnip cake aka radish cake aka Chinese radish cake. Basically, it’s fried mush and possibly my favorite dim sum dish, but it’s usually cut in flat squares and three to a plate. This was a pile of cubes, nicely fried on all sides and a bit spicy. Mmmm.
