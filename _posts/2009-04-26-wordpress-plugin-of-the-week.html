<p>After trying to manually turn off comments and pings on all my old posts (you&rsquo;re supposed to take the good with the bad, but I&rsquo;m just gonna outsource the whole thing to Digg and Reddit), some spam is still leaking in. Belatedly, I noticed the <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/extended-comment-options/">Extended Comment Options</a> among my unactivated plugins. Turned it on, works great. I used it to complete the job and turn off all pings and comments on all my posts, but you can specify more refined batch operations like turn off comments after the first ten are posted.</p>
