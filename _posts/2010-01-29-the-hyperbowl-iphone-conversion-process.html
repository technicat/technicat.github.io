<p>Each release of <a href="http://hyperbowl3d.com/">HyperBowl</a> for the iPhone is a bit of an ordeal, since main development takes place on the web player version with Unity Pro, and I have to copy that latest snapshot to Unity iPhone and then hack away at it until it runs at an acceptable frame rate. Sometimes I forget an optimization or two that I&rsquo;d made in a previous release, so this seems as good a time as any to jot down the steps. These are what I remember now - if I missed any, I hope they&rsquo;ll come back to me as soon as I start.
</p><ol><li>Duplicate the Unity Pro project, open up the new project in Unity iPhone, watch it convert.</li>
	<li>In the Player Settings, set the game name</li>
	<li>In the Player Settings, set the most aggressive speed and code stripping settings</li>
	<li>Copy the splash screen and icon files into the project, assign them in the Player Settings</li>
	<li>Replace control and option scripts with iPhone counterparts</li>
	<li>Set Static on all static game objects</li>
	<li>Assign batching script to object groups that move together</li>
	<li>Replace certain materials (like bump maps) with simpler ones</li>
	<li>Change diffuse materials to vertex lit</li>
	<li>Remove transparent objects as necessary</li>
	<li>Remove lights as necessary</li>
	<li>Remove particle effects as necessary</li>
	<li>Remove blob shadows as necessary</li>
	<li>Replace Unity water with simple water</li>
	<li>Use the iPhone background shader for the background</li>
	<li>Replace Ogg Vorbis sound with uncompressed or m4a sounds</li>
	<li>Replace any DXT compressed textures with PVRTC compressed textures</li>
	<li>Set accelerometer frequency to zero</li>
</ol>
And of course, profile, profile, profile&hellip;
