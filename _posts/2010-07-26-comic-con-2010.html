<p>Comic Con 2010 was my second, and once again, I&rsquo;m impressed at how well the organizers run the show. Badge pick-up was a breeze - at every point where I wasn&rsquo;t clear about where to go, a show staffer appeared to guide people in the right direction. And the serpentine line into Ballroom 20 makes me wonder if there&rsquo;s a mathematician in charge.</p>

<p>I only attended for a day, but stayed fifteen hours, sitting in on two panels in the morning, traversing the expo floor in the afternoon (picking up a couple of graphic novels from the CBLDF booth), and watching films in the evening until 2am. The highlight for me was the live showing of this week&rsquo;s Eureka episode, introduced by creator Jaime Paglia and with surprise appearances by cast members Salli Richardson Whitfield, James Callis, and Will Wheaton. They got lots of fan love. It was a good episode, too.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the event was marred the next day by an assault - according to news reports, an altercation ensued when one attendee complained another was sitting too close, and one stabbed the other near the eye with a pen. Fortunately, the injury apparently wasn&rsquo;t serious (although it easily could have been), and to keep things in perspective, the guy wielding the pen was wearing a Harry Potter t-shirt (and I have to wonder if the pen was one of those light-saber pens they were handing out at the Clone Wars booth). Out of a four-day event with 126,000 attendees, that still compares favorably to Laker fans rioting (something to keep in mind as Comic Con considers moving to LA).</p>
