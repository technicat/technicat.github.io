I finally found one thing I like about Windows Vista - the [Snipping Tool](http://lifehacker.com/software/windows-vista/windows-vista-tip--take-screenshots-with-the-snipping-tool-228885.php).&nbsp; On XP, [SnagIt](http://www.techsmith.com/) was a big help for window snapshots, but I lost my license key and the trial version I installed on Vista kept popping up every day with a friendly reminder “30 days until trial expiration”, “29 days until trial expiration”, and so on…After 30 days, I never wanted to see the SnagIt window again, so a Google search turned up what was sitting under my Accessories menu all along (it gives you an option to place a shortcut on the system tray, but it really should be there from the start.

The Mac already has an adequate window capture facility, but I found [SnapZ ProX](http://www.ambrosiasw.com/utilities/snapzprox/) an improvement, with conveniences like specifying exact pixel dimensions of the capture. That’s a bonus, since I purchased the product for video capture (though in the odd world of software, I really purchased a license to use the software).

I wasn’t happy this time around to find after a long test capture that the updated trial I downloaded this time added a watermark (without any indication that it was going to do so), and I had to redo it after purchasing the license. I might have gone with one of the alternatives I’ve seen recommended, like the much cheaper [IShowU](http://store.shinywhitebox.com/home/home.html), but I’m not [Walt Mossberg](http://walt.allthingsd.com/) - I don’t have time to try out every single one - and I’d used a previous trial of SnapZ ProX to successfully create a video. That installation was probably time-restricted but didn’t mar the result in any way. First impressions count!

I still need to figure out the performance limits of the SnapZ ProX on my (somewhat aged) MacBook Pro. I was overly ambitious with the quality settings on this first attempt with this setup - it’s pretty glitchy, and my manual “camera work” would be better replaced by a canned camera sequence:
