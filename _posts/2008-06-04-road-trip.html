<p>Inspired by a friend&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.roarware.com/southamerica/">South American road trip</a> and my recent reading of <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/85684.Route_66_The_Mother_Road_75th_Anniversary_Edition">Route 66: The Mother Road</a>, I started driving to Oklahoma earlier this week. Work intervened before I got too far, and I turned back (I have to admit, I was already having second thoughts about all that driving), but at least I did see stretches of historic <a href="http://www.historic66.com/">Route 66</a>. Here&rsquo;s a fragment in <a href="http://www.sbsun.com/ci_8283962">Devore</a>:</p>
