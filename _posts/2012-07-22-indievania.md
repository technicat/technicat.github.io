Development-wise, my tendency is to do what I feel like doing. Marketing-wise, it’s a combination of that plus what I see other people doing, especially if they have a game called Angry Birds. Anyway, I happened to check out a game called Cubemen and saw they’re on Indievania, so took some time to deploy HyperBowl on it (both the [Mac](http://indievania.com/games/hyperbowl-mac-edition) and [Windows](http://ndievania.com/games/hyperbowl-windows-edition) versions). The web site has some nice features - a pay-what-you-want facility, integration with your facebook page, twitter feed, and blog. And it looks nice, partly because there are no ads (so I wonder how they make money?)
