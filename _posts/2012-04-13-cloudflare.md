I started trying out CloudFlare a couple of days ago. It takes a day to see the resulting stats, so here are the initial results (I only have stats for my [Fugu Games](http://fugugames.com/) site right now). Supposedly I should get a two-fold improvement in web access time - for now, Iâ€™ll take their word for it. The graph looks nice and is somewhat interactive. Not a lot of detail, but it is successful in making me more paranoid about web attacks.
