<p>Well, I guess I&rsquo;ll keep this blog going. It&rsquo;s a convenient feed into <a href="http://facebook.com/">Facebook</a> (as far as I can tell, I can only import one blog into Facebook without using an additional app), and I still want to post my <a href="http://wordseye.com/">WordsEye</a> &ldquo;art&rdquo;, like this latest one:</p>



<p>[caption id=&ldquo;attachment_1300&rdquo; align=&ldquo;alignnone&rdquo; width=&ldquo;491&rdquo; caption=&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a PC&rdquo;]<a href="http://www.wordseye.com/view-picture?sid=11520"><img class="size-full wp-image-1300" title="11520" src="http://itshardtofondlepenguins.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/11520.jpg" alt="I'm a PC" width="491" height="355"/></a>[/caption]</p>

<p>Also, I feel kind of lazy after I stopped blogging - like the way I stopped using my Wii Fit (I just don&rsquo;t want to see the on-screen nagging about why I gained a couple of pounds).</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve got comments turned off now (at least I think I do - I still have spam streaming in for previous posts), which seems to diminish the blogness of this blog, but I figure any post that gets really popular will garner plenty of civil and uncivil discourse on <a href="http://digg.com/">digg</a> or <a href="http://reddit.com/">reddit</a>, like this <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/6uex6/design_patterns_are_in_purgatory">argument on design patterns</a>, and some people respond to blogs on their own blogs, like <a href="http://kawagner.blogspot.com/">this post that said I got it totally wrong</a>. That&rsquo;s fine - rebuttal posts like that probably took more effort than I spent on my own, and certainly more time than it takes just to post a comment (some are fun to read, and some looked like they were sneezed out by someone having a bad day)</p>

<p>I do regret accidentally deleting a comment on my post regarding the recent game credits controversy. But not enough to try rolling back the database. So I&rsquo;ll just recap the point made by a well-known game designer, that game development involves a lot more types of talent than general software development and game developers rely on game credits to stay in the industry and further their careers. That&rsquo;s a valid point, and, although the issue of formal crediting can get pretty complicated, as in the film industry, I think it&rsquo;d be pretty cool to have a database like <a href="http://mobygames.com/">MobyGames</a>, but for software in general. If you worked on, say, MacOSX, wouldn&rsquo;t you like to point to your name, along with several hundred others, and brag, &ldquo;see, I worked on that&rdquo;.( On the other hand, if you worked on Vista, you might not be so eager)</p>
