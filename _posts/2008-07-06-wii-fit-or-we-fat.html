<p>Or should I say Wii phat? It is apparently the latest greatest thing since sliced bread (or the great thing since the <a href="http://www.nintendo.com/wii">Wii</a>) - last time I checked, the nearby Toys R Us had a sign posted declaring the <a href="http://www.nintendo.com/wiifit/launch/?ref=">Wii Fit</a> was still out of stock. (I missed their first batch by a couple of hours and ended up paying a $30 markup for a unit from the indie dealer next door. My only consolation is that they&rsquo;re still out of stock, too)

After diligently using the <a href="http://www.nintendo.com/wiifit/launch/?ref=">Wii Fit</a> almost daily for the last two months, I&rsquo;d have to say it&rsquo;s everything it&rsquo;s chalked up to be, except that I&rsquo;ve gained several pounds. (I hope it&rsquo;s muscle) It is well-designed (as typical of Nintendo) and engaging (in a typically Nintendo manner) and a surprisingly effective substitute as a trainer. Perhaps too much like a real trainer - I obey it&rsquo;s authority, but it&rsquo;s getting on my nerves. I could do without:
</p><ul><li>the insults, e.g. &ldquo;The Agility Test apparently isn&rsquo;t your strength. Do you have trouble walking in a straight line?&rdquo;</li>
	<li>the music - I can&rsquo;t get that damn tune out of my head</li>
	<li>monopolizing my Wii - since I don&rsquo;t want to swap discs every day, I&rsquo;ve stopped playing other Wii games</li>
	<li>the yoga instructor - she looks OK, but for a CG character she&rsquo;s rather plain (could use a <a href="http://www.tecmo.co.jp/teamninja/">Team Ninja</a> makeover). And she talks and moves real slow. Or maybe that&rsquo;s just yoga.</li>
</ul>
On the other hand, I got my Wii Fit age down to something approximating my real age (in contrast to my <a href="http://www.brainage.com/launch/index.jsp">Brain Age</a> age, which barely got below senility), I learned a thing or two about yoga, and if my life ever depends on dressing up as a penguin and sliding around an iceberg to catch fish, or running around in a giant bubble while avoiding bees trying to pop me, I&rsquo;m ready. Plus I think that yoga instructor likes me.
