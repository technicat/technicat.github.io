Lately, I’ve realized the work-recognition awards I’ve received have gone down in pizzazz over the years.

Government agencies really know how to make a big production out of it. The [Space Telescope Science Institute](http://www.stsci.edu/) held an annual show which included a most-valuable-employee award. One year, the entire IT group received it. Just for being on the employee rolls in the years preceding the Hubble repair mission, I received this very cool poster in the mail (two years after leaving the Institute), along with a patch flown on the Shuttle.

I really didn’t have to do too much at the Institute besides make my bosses feel like they were in charge (and I didn’t do a good job of that), but in my next job at a defense contractor (contracting on-site at a contractor subcontracted by a contractor on a big defense project), there was real crunch time, and apparently not much money. They showed their appreciation with letters (“Here’s a letter for your file - maybe this will do your career some good”). I got one from my employer, one from my on-site manager (our client), and the most important-looking one from the Navy (our collective client). It has an impressive letterhead, but I wish they spelled my name right.

When I finally made my way to a Silicon Valley startup, I got both a plaque and letter, and (finally!) a check. Again, they misspelled my name. The plaque exemplifies Silicon Valley optimism with short attention span - it has room to list several product releases, and they gave up on it after one release. A coworker kindly filled up some space on it with a post-it note after I compared it to those employee-of-the-month awards you see on the walls of KFC.

Before the dot-com boom went bust, I joined a wireless internet startup, which dispensed with ceremony and just offered the prospect (false hope) of IPO riches. I still have the stock certificate hanging on my wall. At least my name is spelled correctly, again.

Those were the glory days. After I joined the game industry, the only project-completion rewards I heard about were at the beginning of a project (“…everyone got bonuses on the previous project…I’ll take care of you…but I’m not promising anything”). If you last til the end, you’ll get a game credit. And your boss will want gratitude for all the late-night takeout dinners.
