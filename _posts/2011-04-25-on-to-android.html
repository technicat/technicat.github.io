<p>I&rsquo;ve been holding off on Android development because I couldn&rsquo;t figure out how to use my phone for testing and the firmware I had wasn&rsquo;t compatible with Unity, anyway. But I broke my phone and the warranty replacement came with upgraded firmware (Android 2.2), and I figured out where that Enable USB Debugging checkbox is in the Android settings menu, and I&rsquo;m stalled on my iPhone development while Unity and Apple sort out the recent iOS 4.3 SDK issues, so I took the plunge this weekend.</p>

<p>First, I converted a couple of my <a href="http://appmakr.com/">AppMakr</a> apps to Android. I wish there was some way I could just hit a &ldquo;Make Android&rdquo; button in an existing project, but I had to create new versions of each from scratch and cut-and-paste the RSS feeds into them. AppMakr seems to have a more limited feature set for Android than iOS, but still, my <a href="https://market.android.com/details?id=com.appmakr.app175485">Blue Mars News</a> app is nearly identical on Android, and <a href="https://market.android.com/details?id=com.appmakr.app159234">La Petite Baguette</a>, rejected by Apple, is finally published, this time on the Android Market! (so there, Apple!)</p>

<p>Self-publishing on the Android Market really feels like self-publishing - hit the Publish button, and soon after, it&rsquo;s there. This made me giddy enough to cough up all the money I haven&rsquo;t made on the App Store to buy a license of Unity Android Pro. I converted my <a href="https://market.android.com/details?id=com.technicat.FuguBowl">Fugu Bowl</a> app easily - most of the time was spent removing the iOS plugins from <a href="http://prime31.com/">Prime31 Studios</a> and figuring out the right player settings for publication.</p>

<p><a href="http://itshardtofondlepenguins.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/Screen-shot-2011-04-25-at-8.01.29-PM.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4502" title="Screen shot 2011-04-25 at 8.01.29 PM" src="http://itshardtofondlepenguins.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/Screen-shot-2011-04-25-at-8.01.29-PM.png" alt="" width="292" height="719"/></a></p>

<p>After publishing, I made an update after deciding to specify Android 2.2 as the minimum Android OS. I know this could limit my potential customer base, but I don&rsquo;t want to get a bunch of customer complaints about how the app doesn&rsquo;t run. I&rsquo;ll probably have enough trouble anyway with all the various Android platforms I haven&rsquo;t tested on. Anyway, the only thing that threw me off a bit during the update was the need to increment the Bundle Version Code.</p>

<p>The biggest irritation so far has been the screen capture process. There&rsquo;s no hardware button combination on the phone for that, so I have to run the ddms program in the Android SDK tools directory. That worked OK for Fugu Bowl, but for <a href="https://market.android.com/details?id=com.technicat.ElektraDance">Elektra Dance</a>, the capture shows a lot of shearing artifacts.</p>

<p>I ended up just cropping some captures from the iPhone version (the Android Market accepts several resolutions for screen captures, none of them matching the iOS resolutions).</p>

<p>Next, try out the AdMob and Mobclix plugins, set up merchant account for paid apps, and see what happens&hellip;</p>
