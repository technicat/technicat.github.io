<p>It used to really bug me when I received form emails, but I&rsquo;ve seen a recent trend toward pseudo-personalized form emails, particularly from mobile ad companies, and I think that&rsquo;s even worse. For example, I received this, yesterday:
</p><blockquote>
<div>Hi HyperBowl,</div>
<div></div>
<div>I came across your apps and love the way you&rsquo;ve hit the market with great games, like XXXXX. I wanted to reach out to you personally[&hellip;]</div></blockquote>
<div>OK, that&rsquo;s pretty funny. Remember to fill out your XXXXX&rsquo;s! And did they really think my name is HyperBowl? And also, I&rsquo;m already working with them.</div>
<div></div>
<div>This one, from a different mobile ad company, was a little more polished:</div>
<div></div>
<div>
<blockquote>Hello Technicat, LLC,

 

I wanted to reach out to you to let you know that several of our top advertisers have requested to advertise on HyperBowl.


We specialize in this category with solid results for our partners. We use advanced ad units that are generating 3-5x&rsquo;s more revenue than traditional mobile banner ads.


I would like to discuss this with you in further detail.</blockquote>
That one I responded to, noting again in this case that I&rsquo;d already talked to a couple of their representatives, and asking out of curiosity, who are these top advertisers who are interested specifically in my game? I received not an answer, but instead this very familiar email from the same person:
<blockquote>Hello Dev Team,

 

I wanted to reach out to you to let you know that several of our top US advertisers have requested to advertise on “HyperBowl.” We specialize in this particular category with solid results for our partners.

 

I would like to discuss this with you in further detail. </blockquote>
So, just in case I was under the mistaken impression from the first email that they really knew who I was, they ignored my response and sent a more generic version. Adding quotes around &ldquo;HyperBowl&rdquo; was a nice touch (I can visual the double-finger gesturing as they say it). It&rsquo;s like a Turing test where they&rsquo;re trying to fail.

Sometimes the premise of the email is a tip-off. Like &ldquo;meet us at whatsitdev2012&rdquo; where the event is in a different hemisphere from you. Or if you reply, and they reply, and they sound surprised. Yep, you can sound surprised over the internet - is there an emoticon for that?
