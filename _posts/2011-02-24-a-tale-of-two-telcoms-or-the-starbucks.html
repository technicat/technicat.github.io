<p>When my Samsung Vibrant failed recently, transmitting my voice successfully but only returning static from the other end, I was almost glad - it&rsquo;s an excuse to switch to Verizon and get an iPhone. But when I brought my phone to the T-Mobile store, they verified the problem and said they&rsquo;d just ship me a new one under warranty, and, no muss, no fuss, I got a box at my doorstep two days later, switched my battery and sim card into the new one, and popped the old one into the box for return. I guess I was surprised, because my trial purchase of an AT&amp;T mobile broadband modem turned into a very expensive trial (&ldquo;we don&rsquo;t prorate&rdquo;, explained the customer service rep as they charged me for the remainder of the month) This is why I&rsquo;ve stayed with T-Mobile the last eight years, the customer service (although I haven&rsquo;t tried to cancel a contract - I hear that can get expensive)</p>

<p>In contrast, there&rsquo;s Time Warner. Their store and installation reps are fine - I don&rsquo;t like the door-to-door salesmen who throw random pricing packages at me like used car salesmen or the telemarketers who&rsquo;ve been calling me the last three years despite my repeated requests to take me off their calling list. And by the way, calling me at 8:30 last night while I&rsquo;m watching TV to sell me their TV service - really annoying. Apparently, it really bugs them that I only have their cable internet and not their cable TV. Well, I only got their internet service because I had a contract developing with CryEngine 2, and at the time, a laptop just couldn&rsquo;t cut it, but now I&rsquo;m all laptop again and I can just do my Internet work at Starbucks (I did that for a few years before the CryEngine project, and it&rsquo;s a pretty nice work day, tapping away at the keyboard while sipping tea at a coffee shop near the beach&hellip;). So I guess TW did me a favor - time to cancel them and put that $60/month into lattes.</p>
