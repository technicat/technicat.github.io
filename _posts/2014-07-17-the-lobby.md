These modern coworking spaces with the emphasis on making everyone visible and audible strike me as emanating from the minds of ad industry types. I’m not making this up - I’ve interviewed at an ad place and that’s what it’s like. Another clue: all the coffee table books are about logos, infographics, record covers…but look at the work desks and you can see what people really need to read are books on Drupal and Javascript (Once again, I miss the tech culture of BBN - the last place I worked at that had a really good library).

I’m not just complaining about this shiny office because I walked into the glass wall of a meeting room (“Oh, beer!” I said, spying the keg inside. My Homer Simpson moment). But I have to admit, they know their interior design and they do some stuff right. This newly-opened lobby is the best one I’ve seen in an office building - big sofas, nice artwork, garage door opening to the street (I think the locals are figuring it’s a nicer place to hang out than the Starbucks down the street). In fact, I’m using it as my real office - my desk is just a charging station. And I’m getting better at the pinball machine.
