I finally got around to updating [Fugu Maze](http://itunes.apple.com/app/fugu-maze/id295808255?mt=8) for the iPad. At the iPad full screen resolution, I think it looks pretty good, and itâ€™s faster than the iPhone version (although I had to turn off fog). I was concerned the two-thumb control might not translate, but seems to me it still works. The shake-to-scramble feature is more of a workout on the iPad, though.
