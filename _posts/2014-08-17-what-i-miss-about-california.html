<p>I&rsquo;ve been complaining about how much I miss California for a while now. My serial whining includes how much better the weather is over there (OK, at least in Hong Kong and New Jersey I don&rsquo;t have dry skin problems, and there&rsquo;s no water rationing), the food (sure, you can&rsquo;t beat Hong Kong for Chinese food, but if you&rsquo;re in the mood for a fish taco, the pickings are slim, and in New York, $10 for a food truck bahn mi?), and the housing cost (I&rsquo;m not kidding - if you&rsquo;re not dead set on living with the googlers in San Francisco, you can find a nicer place to rent than my $1500/month roach motel in New Jersey, not to mention that $2000/month hovel in Soho they wanted me to pay a year in advance).</p>

<p>But what I miss about California is that they don&rsquo;t assume I&rsquo;m from somewhere else. Alright, last year, a hotel maid in Anaheim bowed to me and said konichiwa, and the year before someone at Denny&rsquo;s approached me to tell me about his China trip and how polite the people are there (they&rsquo;re always polite when you can&rsquo;t hear the rude shit they&rsquo;re saying in their own language), but one idiot a year is not too bad.</p>

<p>In contrast, &ldquo;Where are you from?&rdquo; is a regular conversation starter in New York. And they&rsquo;re not asking which state I&rsquo;m from. One guy even asked me if I&rsquo;m Korean, because he&rsquo;s interested in buying a Korean car. Yeah, that follows.</p>

<p>In New Jersey, I&rsquo;ve encountered a new problem - every time I go to the local Chinese restaurants, the other customers assume I work there. For example, I&rsquo;ve been complimented on my beautiful baby (the one the owners parked in the hallway), just recently a guy walked up to me and informed me he ordered beef and broccoli, and I can tell they think I&rsquo;m the delivery guy when I leave with takeout. To be fair, the owners did offer me a delivery job (I declined, but I should have asked what they paid. Who knows, with tips&hellip;)</p>

<p>Admittedly, that&rsquo;s not quite as inane as what I used to get in Boston. Let&rsquo;s see, there was &ldquo;You Chinese don&rsquo;t like Koreans, right?&rdquo; The always classic, &ldquo;Do you speak English?&rdquo; (How do you answer that?) And my favorite, the woman who walked all the way up the MIT steps to hand me an ESL flyer.</p>

<p>If we&rsquo;re scoring for friendliness, Oregon is tops. Every time I visit that state, I get one &ldquo;Welcome to America!&rdquo;</p>

<p>I did actually come back to America, periodically, from a consulting gig in Hong Kong, and I had a similar problem there. Even if it was clear I was not a native HongKonger (usually as soon as I tried to say something), they assumed I was from Taiwan, or the mainland, or Singapore, or Japan, or even Australia (did my Crocodile Dundee accent throw them off?) But usually Japan. There was one guy who kept telling people I was Japanese, even after I told him repeatedly I&rsquo;m American. Does not compute.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t entirely blame them. Watching American TV from Hong Kong, I can see you might get the impression there&rsquo;s no such thing as an Asian American (at least not any who aren&rsquo;t Chinatown gangsters or recently arrived from Asia), and the BBC shows, forget about it.</p>

<p>I had the same problem in Korea on my last trip back. The hotel clerk apparently wasn&rsquo;t satisfied with my English and asked me to switch to Japanese. Maybe I should just learn Japanese. Then next time someone bows to me and says konichiwa, I&rsquo;ll know how to respond.</p>
