<p>I had a good year, business-wise, but not good enough to start another remodelling project, so I&rsquo;ll settle for a new <a href="http://wordpress.org/">Wordpress</a> theme. The old layout was squashing my <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/themes/">WordsEye</a> pics, anyway (and when the latest Wordpress update unsquashed them, they started overlapping in an unsightly manner).</p>

<p>Aside from the built-in choices, there are quite a few themes available in the <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/themes/">Wordpress theme directory</a>. Some of my favorite looks had broken links or didn&rsquo;t support features I&rsquo;m using, like link categories, so after killing a few hours, I settled on this one. I should really make my own theme from scratch (graphic design skills permitting). Maybe next year&hellip;</p>
