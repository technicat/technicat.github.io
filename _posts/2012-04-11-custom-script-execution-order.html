<p>Game scripting systems usually provide Update callbacks that execute once per frame. But sometimes you want to execute some code after one or more objects have been updated, e.g. I want to update the ball-following camera in <a href="http://hyperbowl3d.com/">HyperBowl</a> after the ball&rsquo;s position has been updated. So Unity has a typical hack, a LateUpdate callback that runs after all Update&rsquo;s have been run, and I use LateUpdate instead of Update in the camera code.</p>

<p>But now I have another camera script that ensures the camera doesn&rsquo;t dip below the ground, and that needs to run after the follow code. I don&rsquo;t expect Unity to supply a LaterUpdate callback or LateLateUpdate, but they have something better. If you select a script in the Project pane, the Inspector will present an option to customize script order:</p>

<p>Once you click on that, you select and order scripts before and after the default. For example, I specify that my follow camera script runs after other scripts, and then I specify the ground hugging script executes after the follow script. And I just use Update, no more LateUpdate&rsquo;s.</p>
