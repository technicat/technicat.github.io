Before I go to sleep, I try to recount my accomplishments for the day. Sort of a personal scrum meeting. Also, it helps avoid insomnia. I won’t inflict that on you readers in the form of daily blogs (that’s what Facebook statuses are for), but it’s been a busy month, so I’ll list the highlights:

- Got an iPad. I considered waiting until my birthday (that’s how I rationalized getting my first MacBook Pro), but I felt I should get a move on in updating my iPhone apps. Besides, they were in stock at the Apple Store.
- Updated [HyperBowl](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/hyperbowl/id344209253?mt=8) for the iPad. Not too bad - it took a couple of days, got rejected because now it needs to support multiple orientations (at least upside-down), resubmitted, and got accepted.
- Filed my taxes. I actually start in December, filling it in and itemizing deductions over the months until I can’t stand it anymore. I always leave some money on the table in return for keeping some last bit of sanity. It’s a fair trade, I think.
- Celebrated my birthday by spending a couple of days in San Clemente to relax. Instead of visiting the beach, I raided the local used book store, [Mathom House Books](http://www.mathomhousebooks.com/). Picked up a dozen sci-fi novels.
- Updated the individual [HyperBowl](http://hyperbowl3d.com/) lane apps for the iPad.
- Dropped by the doc for a periodic blood test. Whereupon they called me up and said they got the results and I needed to come in immediately. Whereupon they said, never mind, sorry about that.
- Watched the season DVD set of Breaking Bad.
- Watched the season 2 Blue-Ray set of Sarah Connor Chronicles.
- Updated [Fugu Bowl](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/fugubowl/id297032758?mt=8) for the iPad.
- Brought my car in for an oil change. Good news is I only drove a thousand miles since my last oil change five months ago. Bad news is I still ended up spending three hundred dollars.
- Caught up on Flash Forward on the iPad using the ABC Player.
- Caught up on Lost on the iPad using the ABC Player.
- Did some major work on [Blue Mars](http://bluemars.com/). You’ll see it in the next beta release.
Now I need to get going on the next set of iPad releases. But first, I’m going to start catching up on Caprica episodes…
