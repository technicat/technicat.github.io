<p>I noticed a few weeks ago that the City of Huntington Beach made good on their promise (threat) to rename every north-south minor street to &ldquo;Lane&rdquo;, so now I live on Sims Lane nee Sims Street. One of my conspiracy theories was that this was a way to get stimulus money, but they just taped over the &ldquo;St&rdquo; portion of the signs with &ldquo;Ln&rdquo;, so if federal moolah  is involved, then they&rsquo;re not working very hard for it.</p>

<p>I think the real mundane reason for this change is that someone thought it just sounded better. The city officials pushing for the change said it&rsquo;s required to remove inconsistencies in various street databases that pose a public safety issue (aren&rsquo;t you actually introducing inconsistencies?)  Well, it&rsquo;s really to conform to an old city specification that north-south streets be named lane (what about all the curved and diagonal and L-shaped streets in my neighborhood?). And every other city has similar specifications (they all have the same convention?).  And if we need help from the Long Beach fire department, they&rsquo;ll be confused if we don&rsquo;t have this street naming convention (again, they all have the same convention? and isn&rsquo;t it more confusing that we change street names running from outside into our city?) And these specifications are necessary for the computerized dispatch  systems to work (you&rsquo;re kidding, the computer actually cares if a street is named Lane or Street) And don&rsquo;t worry about your mail, the post office computer system doesn&rsquo;t care about street suffixes (well, the fire department should use their computer). The specification is really needed for public safety new hires who  aren&rsquo;t familiar with the city (so you were making up that stuff about the computer?) And you can change your financial information gradually over time (thanks!).</p>

<p>Watching the city council meeting where this was discussed and just about rubber stamped (no discussion of cost or how it would be executed), I thought, these guys really, really want this change. It reminded me of all of my workplaces where management made a fuss over coding style conventions and just said all kinds of stuff to justify it. It&rsquo;s really important for code safety. It&rsquo;s important for new hires or others visiting the code. Every company has a convention. It&rsquo;s not bad, you&rsquo;ll get used to it. So someone goes through and changes everyone&rsquo;s code and introduces bugs, and I still end up looking at three-page long functions making improper use of the language and API&rsquo;s. But it must be good code, because it&rsquo;s following a coding convention. And it&rsquo;s got design patterns (coding conventions masquerading as software architecture). And from that point on, I don&rsquo;t believe anything more from the powers that be, since they made a fuss about this instead of focusing on important matters  (there&rsquo;s a coding style guidebook behind every worthless startup stock certificate on my wall). Same with my civic leaders - next time I watch a city council meeting, I&rsquo;ll be sure to disbelieve everything they say.</p>
