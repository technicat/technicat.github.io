<p>I remember when a boss of mine some time back wanted credit for issuing paychecks on time (mostly), I thought (to myself) that paying employees was the absolute minimum obligation of an employer. Any less, it wouldn&rsquo;t be a company, it would be a charity. What if I wanted a bonus just for showing up to work?</p>

<p>Silly me. And I&rsquo;m not talking about AIG. Where the game industry may lag historically in such areas as software engineering practices (although I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s really true, anymore), when it comes to dubious business practices, the game biz keeps up with the latest fads. Back-dating options and SEC investigations? Take Take-Two. Handing out bonuses while going bankrupt? We have Midway, otherwise known for being one of Sumner Redstone&rsquo;s long underperforming investments. According to <a href="http://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=22990">gamasutra</a>, Midway execs submitted a bonus plan for milestones already accomplished and milestones they were obligated to complete under bankruptcy proceedings, totalling four times the bonuses awarded when they weren&rsquo;t going bankrupt. Did they have a meeting and say, &ldquo;The ship&rsquo;s going down, let&rsquo;s divvy up the loot?&rdquo;</p>
