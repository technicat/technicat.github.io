My third attempt at deploying [HyperBowl as a Facebook app](https://apps.facebook.com/126959907158/). The first two were via DimeRocker. This time around, I was just playing around with Heroku to try some Ruby on Rails stuff and I got distracted from my original goal when I found that the Facebook developer page has an option to automatically populate a Heroku account with an app template. So I just wedged a copy of the [HyperBowl web site](http://hyperbowl3d.com/) into a PHP template for a Facebook app. And by the way, I love using git to upload to Heroku.
