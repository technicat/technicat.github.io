After years of complaining about how much I hate [Healthnet](http://www.healthnet.com/), I switched to [Anthem Blue Cross](http://www.anthem.com/) policy that featured compatibility with a [Health Savings Account](http://www.ustreas.gov/offices/public-affairs/hsa/). At first I wasn’t impressed by the HSA - it’s basically an [IRA](http://www.aarp.org/money/financial_planning/sessionseven/individual_retirement_accounts.html) that you can use to fund current health care expenses, but it requires a high-deductible policy, there’s a monthly management fee, the maximum contribution is much lower than an IRA, and the allowable medical expenses are limited, e.g. you can’t use it to pay your health care premiums. Still, it should save a few hundred in taxes a year and it can accumulate into a wad of tax-free cash when you hit 65.

I’m not sure Anthem Blue Cross is going to be much of an improvement over Healthnet. I thought I’d applied for coverage starting 8/1 but instead I got a policy starting 7/15, which meant overlapping policies for half a month (Healthnet won’t let you cancel before the end of the month). But that might have been my mistake when I stopped and restarted the application on ehealthinsurance. More annoying, Anthem Blue Cross immediately raised my premium by 25% because of my Crestor prescription. If they’re going to cash my first month’s premium deposit they should tell me beforehand I’m getting a more expensive policy than I applied for, and they should at least document that policy on their premium listings. And their bills include a $2 “administrative fee”. What’s this nickel-and-diming? Combine that with the fact that they switched me to a lower cost cholesterol medicine that somehow costs me $30 more, the cost difference between my old policy and new one is getting smaller and smaller. I should have applied to [Blue Shield](http://blueshieldca.com/) - I’ve had better experiences with them and only went with Anthem because of the supposedly lower premium.

A portent of things to come: the most recent bill included a page informing policyholders that health insurance isn’t like auto insurance - your premium doesn’t go up with each claim. Rather, your premium is dictated by your age and demographic. Apparently, that’s supposed to be a good thing. (“Complain to your auto mechanic”, the pamphlet cheerfully advises) But while my auto insurance premiums decreased in the last six years, at Healthnet, where I never exceeded my $1000 deductible, my premium increased every year, quadrupling in six years. I can’t think of anything else that has gone up so fast - not gas, not home prices (even at the peak), certainly not my income. What would have been my premium in another ten years? I’d do the calculations, but I’m getting old and feeble…
