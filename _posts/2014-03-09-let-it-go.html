<p>One result of failing to blog-a-day is that it&rsquo;s easy to violate the rule of leave-something-positive. Every time I use social media to vent, I try to follow up with something more pleasant, because no one wants to just read grumpy pants material.</p>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t watch the Oscars, haven&rsquo;t been keeping up with late night TV, and I only know this singer by her Travolta name, but I gather this is a popular video - and it&rsquo;s fun!</p>
