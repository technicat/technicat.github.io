<p>I haven&rsquo;t had much use for Yahoo. I had an account to participate in a Yahoo group several years ago, but when I changed my email address to avoid spam, the process of getting back into my account was somehow too mystifying. I don&rsquo;t even remember that username, anymore.</p>

<p>But I wanted to try the instructions from <a href="http://appmakr.com/">AppMakr</a> on using <a href="http://pipes.yahoo.com/">Yahoo Pipes</a> to process Facebook RSS feeds, so I created a new account (it actually granted me one of my requested usernames without qualifying numbers or punctuation marks - that&rsquo;s a good start!) and created my Pipe. It&rsquo;s pretty cool! Anytime you can just drag, drop and connect in a browser just makes the web more fun. Yahoo!</p>
