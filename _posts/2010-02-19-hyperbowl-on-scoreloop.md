[HyperBowl](http://hyperbowl3d.com/) is now on [Scoreloop](http://community.scoreloop.com/games/HyperBowl). Here’s their supplied score widget showing some HyperBowl activity.

I’m not sure Scoreloop really meshes that well with HyperBowl. For example, I set the score sorting to descending by level and descending by score. The problem with that is a low score on the Forest Lane will be ranked higher than a high score on the Rome Lane. On the other hand, if I sort just by the score, then the easy high scores on the Classic Lane will dominate. Ideally, I’d like to see high scores per level. It might make more sense to just use Scoreloop one the lanes that I release as individual apps.

Related to that, right now it seems you can beat a challenge score from one level with a score from another. That’s probably my mistake, though - I should defer the initial option to start a challenge until after the lane selection (right now it’s in an earlier menu). One update, coming up.

Still, there is a problem in that anytime the Scoreloop GUI is brought up, the challenge option is there, which means it shows up when you finish a lane and the score is submitted. I think the idea is that you’re supposed to handle that eventuality in your own code, but using the supplied Unity plugin, your options are limited. I may try Agon Online, next. I started with Scoreloop because they reached out to me and they actually had some printed documentation. My first impressions are that Agon may have the easiest integration and more comprehensive documentation and OpenFeint has the most involved, but also the brings the largest player base. But we’ll see…
