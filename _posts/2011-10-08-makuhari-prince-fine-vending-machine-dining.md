_Originally written on Epinions in November 2003:_

On my recent trip to the Tokyo Game Show, I selected the Makuhari Prince Hotel for convenience. It is one of the closest hotels to the Tokyo Convention Center and is connected to the center by a covered walkway.

As a bonus, I discovered the impressive level of Japanese vending machine technology. The Makuhari Prince features clusters of vending machines on their first and third floors, which offer a variety of sodas, juice and beer, ice cream, cigarettes and, my favorite, microwave dinners that are heated inside the machine upon order.

These machines, and the well-stocked bakery/gift shop on the first floor, fed me for most of my stay. The hotel provided coupons for the breakfast buffets - two of the hotel restuarants offering American-style breakfast and one offering Japanese style. The Japanese-style breakfast was OK, but may be an adjustment for anyone without an Asian dining background. But the Japanese version of American-style breakfasts apparently involves limp bacon, bland eggs and itty-bitty sausages. Soon I was longing for a Denny’s Grand Slam.

However, the two upper-level restaurants boast spectacular views of the nearby Tokyo Bay. The hotel advertises that all its rooms have a view of the bay - that was fortunately true of my room, otherwise it would have been completely claustrophobic. It’s not much of an exaggeration to say that the remote was superfluous - I could nearly reach from my single bed to the TV.

Contributing to the submarine bunkroom appearance, the bathroom was elevated (watch that first step), and the door looked like it was completely sealed on closing - perhaps it was some sort of self-cleaning bathroom. And speaking of self-cleaning, the toilet featured a number of bidet and other spray-your-bottom options.

I would have appreciated more towels - they only provided one set a day, and I worked up a sweat at the convention and walking around. It’s not a touristy area, but the hotel is across the street from a pleasant beach by the bay and is next door to a park with a Japanese tea garden. A few blocks down are the various shopping plazas/malls and the train station and bus stop.

Desk service was mixed. Upon arrival, the receptionist wouldn’t let me check in until the official 2pm check-in time. So I had to kill half an hour. They were a lot more helpful in getting me out of there. At check-out time (they might be sticklers about that, too), the attendant was very thorough in explaining how to get to Tokyo and gave me a map, on which he marked the train route and required changes.

Overall, it was a satisfactory stay, with the highlight being the adventure of choosing among the vending machine dinners. But if I return, I may try out one of the other hotels for comparison, and if I have a higher budget, I’ll try out the New Otani Hotel next door which is just as convenient to the convention center but appears to be more upscale.
