<p>There&rsquo;s no shortage of reasons to make games. Do what you love, supposedly it&rsquo;s a huge business where you can rake in the money (I did say supposedly), it&rsquo;s sexier than writing accounting software, you can register for professional passes at E3 and Comic Con, yada yada&hellip;

But one practical incentive I&rsquo;ve found to make games is that it&rsquo;s easier to get them through the App Store approval gauntlet. I can&rsquo;t think of any apps I&rsquo;ve had rejected from the App Store when submitted in the Games category, aside from the occasional technical issue. I might be shooting just around 50/50 in all other categories, though, with rejections like:
</p><ul><li>Primarily a book (when submitting to the Books category).</li>
	<li>Consisting largely of web content (I could say the same of the Facebook app).</li>
	<li>Largely promotional (for a local restaurant I frequent - urm, what about that Pizza Hut app?)</li>
	<li>Not enough functionality (I should have added Game Center integration and changed the category to Games)</li>
</ul>
So my inspiring advice is, make games because they&rsquo;ll let you.
