<p>This latest Snow Leopard update, MacOSX 10.6.4, was the first to exhibit any glitchiness for me. After the update, Firefox was showing some screwy-looking fonts. After some googling and reading a lot of &ldquo;you&rsquo;re missing some fonts&rdquo;, I found a useful tip - reboot in safe mode by holding down the shift key during a restart until the chime sounds. Then reboot again, normally, and voila, fixed!</p>

<p>After the update, Steam, which now throws itself up on my screen after every restart, informed me that there are nVidia performance issues with the latest drivers, so consider refraining from installing the update. Oh, well.</p>
