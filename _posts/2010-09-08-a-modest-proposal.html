<p>Well, the day after Labor Day was a bit of a letdown for me. First, I read the news about the Christian nut job in Florida who&rsquo;s trying to inflame the Muslim nut jobs of the world by burning copies of the Koran. Then I stopped by a used bookstore and heard yet another white Californian complain about Mexicans. And then when I got home I turned on the television and saw a replay of Huntington Beach&rsquo;s 100 year centennial documentary, which described the Japanese-American internment of World War II as being a &ldquo;difficult decision&rdquo; affecting Japanese &ldquo;residents&rdquo; and &ldquo;immigrants&rdquo;, the question of their loyalty having &ldquo;no answer&rdquo;. I was afraid that if I looked at the clock, I might see it turning backwards.</p>

<p>Based on the recent poll showing an increasing number of Americans who think Obama is a Muslim (did everyone forget about that crazy pastor of his?), I&rsquo;m not optimistic that people are going to get smarter, but I have a plan B, based on a whimsical idea I had years ago, inspired by a sci-fi story in which everyone was forcibly relocated every five years so they wouldn&rsquo;t get complacent. My idea is to require everyone to intermarry - I was thinking originally along racial lines but religion would work, too. I&rsquo;m only half-joking - I have Christians, Jews, Muslims and at least one atheist (yours truly) in my family. If we saw those &ldquo;others&rdquo; as our in-laws instead of some nameless, faceless threat, we could work things out in the real American way - as family arguments over Thanksgiving dinner.</p>
