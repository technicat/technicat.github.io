Going indie, and by that I mean developing and shipping my own software, means getting away with a lot of practices that used to drive me nuts in the workplace.

Shipping on untested hardware. I used to think that was ridiculous. But I’m not going to buy every single iOS device, much less Android. At three iPads, two iPod touches, and four Android devices, I feel like I’ve made a conscientious effort.

Shipping on untested software. Until recently, I retained my virtue on this, only building for the latest version of iOS since that’s what I have on all my test devices. But then Apple stopped supporting the first iPad, and I still wanted to, so I built for iOS 5.1 and above. And then a customer asked me to support even older. So I started building for the Unity minimum, 4.0, and it does seem that sales have improved. So that’s the plan from now on.

Version control. I was a latecomer to version control because I spent a lot of years in Lisp groups that didn’t use it (not that I’m blaming Lisp - more of an academic/research setting issue, I think). And then I thought it was the most important thing since sliced bread. And then I stopped using it for myself because Unity didn’t work well with it. But now I’m back - Unity has a mild to moderate level of version control compatibility and I seem to be doing OK with the github app and sourcetree.

Verifying version control and backups. I’ve been at more than one place where years of blissfully executed backups turned out to be corrupted or missing the stuff we really needed backed up. But I perform a clean restore or checkout at most once a year. I’m playing the odds that I have enough redundancy (Time Machine and the occasional CD burn). At least more of my backup is effectively offsite, now.

Code comments. Some people don’t like them at all. I feel you typically need some level of code commenting so future generations know what the heck you were trying to do. And yet, I still have scripts that I look at now and wonder, did I write that? And why?

Code freeze. Nope. Edit, build, quick test, distribute.

Testing. See above. I can get away with this agile-to-a-fault largely because I seem to have forgiving customers - they can be quick to complain, but they’re usually quick to forgive if you respond quickly (even without providing the actual fix quickly). And many of them seem to actually enjoy being part of the QA process (especially when they ask for a feature that I say I can’t test by myself).

Ads. OK, this is more of a personal distaste than a software principle. But for years I eschewed placing ads on my apps. Than I tried out iAds more as a technical test then anything else and found out it brought in a few dollars a day. Now I embrace ads.

Of course, next time I’m working in an office, I’ll still tell everyone they’re doing it wrong.
