<p>The latest update to <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=295808255&amp;mt=8">FuguMaze on the App Store</a> features randomly selected wall textures. Maybe this will solve an atypical problem - the maze reconfiguration is so fast, users think they&rsquo;re in the same maze over and over again. I can only think of one other user interface problem due to seemingly instantaneous performance - sometimes I hit the Get button on my mail reader more than once. I thought about putting in an artificial delay, but that seems hokey. Also tweaked the ambient light - I thought the first version was too light, the second was too dark, maybe this is just right&hellip;</p>
