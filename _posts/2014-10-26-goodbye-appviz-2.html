<p>Appviz 2 stopped keeping up with App Store changes in the beginning of September, which is a few months after the end-of-life announced by the developer, so now I&rsquo;m getting around to deleting it from my Mac. It&rsquo;s a bit of a sentimental goodbye, much like when I finally got rid of my &lsquo;94 Celica last year. Perhaps Appviz is similarly aged in software years - I&rsquo;ve been using it to track the six years I&rsquo;ve been on the App Store.</p>

<p>For now, I&rsquo;m sticking with App Annie instead of trying the new web-based version of Appviz. But here&rsquo;s a final screenshot for old time&rsquo;s sake.</p>
