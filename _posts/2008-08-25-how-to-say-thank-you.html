<p>On a recent tour of <a href="http://chinatownla.com/">LA Chinatown</a>, I was surprised to hear several shopkeepers say &ldquo;<a href="http://everything2.com/index.pl?node_id=1073418">xie xie</a>&rdquo;, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandarin_(linguistics)">Mandarin</a> thank you  (and just about the only Mandarin I know). I&rsquo;ve always thought of Chinatown&rsquo;s as populated with <a href="http://asiafind.com/blog/4216/post_23868.html?dcb=asiafind">Toison</a> and <a href="http://www.cantonese.ca/">Cantonese</a> speakers. But maybe they assumed I was a tourist - I was the only one sporting a Hawaiian shirt, shades and a <a href="http://stargate.mgm.com/sg1/">Stargate SG-1</a> baseball cap.</p>

<p>Even though utterances of xie xie are wasted on me, it still drives me crazy to hear the pronunciation mangled. It&rsquo;s not that difficult, setting aside <a href="http://www.chinaconnectiononline.com/tones.htm">inflection</a> (one battle at a time) - it more or less rhymes with &ldquo;yeah, yeah&rdquo;, yet many, like sports reporter <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Gray_(sportscaster)">Jim Gray</a> during the 2008 Olympics, pronounce it &ldquo;<a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/chichi">chichi</a>&rdquo;, or sometimes &ldquo;shay-shay&rdquo;. It was an Olympic highlight for me when IOC president<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacques_Rogge"> Jacque Rogges</a> pronounced it correctly at the closing ceremonies. But he&rsquo;s a polyglot.</p>

<p>I guess once you&rsquo;re past a certain age, it&rsquo;s hard to add flexibility to your speech, especially if you&rsquo;re starting with a strong accent (although I&rsquo;m sure to some extent accent is in the eye of the beholder - every time I move I&rsquo;m told I have an accent - a California accent?). I recall in a Wellesley Chinese course (there to meet girls but all I got was slightly improved Mandarin comprehension), a student from the South had a terrible time speaking with precise inflection. Although after living in Boston and Dallas, I&rsquo;d say Southerners are much better at dropping their accents and speaking TV English than New Englanders (where&rsquo;d all those r&rsquo;s go?) Interestingly, among my foreign-born colleagues, the best speakers of accent-less <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0098749/">90210</a> English are Scandinavian.</p>

<p>In a <a href="http://occs.org/">Orange County Computer Society</a> talk on the <a href="http://onelaptop.org/">One Laptop</a> project, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Kay">Alan Kay</a>, in response to a question about his opinion on bilingual education, said there are studies indicating that learning multiple languages in childhood improves flexilibility in thinking in other areas. So perhaps those <a href="http://www.proenglish.org/">English as an Official Language advocates</a> (which strikes me more as a &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to hear any more Spanish&rdquo; movement) should worry more about making sure American kids can speak internationally. But if English does become &ldquo;official&rdquo; (please, let&rsquo;s not end up with something like <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/canada/montreal/story/2008/02/14/qc-olf-0214.html">Quebec&rsquo;s language law</a>), I look forward to the outlawing of text-message spelling (&ldquo;OMG!&rdquo;), sportscasters overusing &ldquo;thus far&rdquo;, mispronunciations like &ldquo;<a href="http://people.ischool.berkeley.edu/~nunberg/nucular.html">nucular</a>&rdquo;, misuse of words like &ldquo;systemic&rdquo; for &ldquo;systematic&rdquo;, long-standing mis-words that won&rsquo;t go away (&ldquo;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irregardless">irregardless</a>&rdquo;, &ldquo;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iwrWbYR1cNw">flammable</a>&rdquo;), and horrendous new ones like &ldquo;<a href="http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/conline/pubs/credit/pretext.shtm">pretexting</a>&rdquo; and &ldquo;<a href="http://www.merriam-webster.com/info/newwords07.htm">ginormous</a>&rdquo;.</p>
