<img src="/tumblr_files/tumblr_njshwcEmis1tgne1po1_1280.png"/><br/><p>This seems &ldquo;less than very good&rdquo; to me. Only a truncated view of the latest message is visible on the left despite having a whole column available, and there&rsquo;s little room to see the entire thread on the right. In fact, it&rsquo;s not obvious there&rsquo;s a scrolling view on the right (although that&rsquo;s an issue with Apple&rsquo;s standard disappearing scrollbar)</p>
