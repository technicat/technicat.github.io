I’ve been thinking about dropping the Amazon affiliate program, because it might compromise my journalistic integrity, and I’ve made only $1.70 from it. Also, it’s a pain adding the affiliate links and that affiliate notice (which you’re supposed to put on your web page and no one seems to do that) takes up some real estate. But you know what, it’s kind of interesting to see what people buy. Here’s where I made my buck and change commission.
