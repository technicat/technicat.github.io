<p>WordsEye Feature has been on the <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=305827351&amp;mt=8">App Store</a> for a while, but I finally got around to knocking out a <a href="http://www.apple.com/downloads/dashboard/justforfun/wordseyefeature.html">Mac widget</a>. It&rsquo;s also running as a web player on <a href="http://www.fugugames.com/">Fugu Games </a>- here it is (click on it to proceed to the next image):</p>
