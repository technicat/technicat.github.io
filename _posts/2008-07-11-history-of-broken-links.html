<p>I decided it&rsquo;s time for some spring cleaning (OK, it&rsquo;s mid-summer, already) of my web sites, and I ran them through <a href="http://dead-links.com/">Dead Links</a>. Examining the residue of broken links is like carbon-dating. This months-old blog didn&rsquo;t reveal any broken links. <a href="http://www.fugugames.com/">Fugu Games</a>, around for a few years and redesigned some months ago, has one broken link. <a href="http://www.technicat.com/">Technicat</a> has been around ten years, underwent its last major redesign five years ago, and exhibits dozens of broken links. The error report gives you some idea what happened in the last five years:
</p><ul><li>Lithtech is gone. Probably the game engine vendor was dismantled after its parent company, the game developer <a href="http://www.lith.com/">Monolith</a>, was acquired by <a href="http://www.warnerbros.com/">Time-Warner</a>.</li>
	<li>The <a href="http://playstation2-linux.com/">Playstation 2/Linux</a> project is abandoned. Or it&rsquo;s &ldquo;undergoing maintenance&rdquo;, but what could they be doing with it after all this time? It&rsquo;s a cool idea that didn&rsquo;t really have much of a point, except for programmers who wanted to learn the PS/2 vector and graphics processors without getting a regular game job. The limited memory and MIPS processor meant it took two days to compile Emacs. It did run <a href="http://www.apache.org/">Apache</a> and make a decent web server appliance. Maybe we&rsquo;ll see a new Playstation 3 Linux site.</li>
	<li>After reorganizing my <a href="http://www.philipchu.com/">personal site</a>, I broke all the links to myself.</li>
	<li>OpenMCL (originally Macintosh Common Lisp) apparently is now <a href="http://trac.clozure.com/openmcl">Clozure CL</a>, but still alive after all these years.</li>
	<li>The mobile 3D game engine <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mophun">Mophun</a> appears to be dead meat. It&rsquo;s owner <a href="http://www.synergenix.se/index.htm">Synergenix</a> (or Blaze?) doesn&rsquo;t list any news since 2006 and it&rsquo;s own link to Mophun is broken. I&rsquo;m glad I didn&rsquo;t spend any time on it.</li>
</ul>
