It was already getting hard to separate the wheat from the chaff on the [Unity forums](http://forums.unity3d.com/), but now that Unity Indie is free, I’m wondering whether I should even bother checking the RSS feed. But the folks at Unity have set up an [answer site](http://answers.unity3d.com/) modeled after [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/). There are some glitches and inconveniences - yet another login, you have to get a [gravatar](http://gravatar.com/) for your avatar pic, the email notification on questions doesn’t seem to work…but hey, it’s beta. On the plus side, the format and encourages specific and focused questions and answers, the voting and reputation system encourages quality questions and answers, and right now it’s like that hole-in-the-wall restaurant you’ve discovered and the word hasn’t gotten out to the hoi polloi, yet.
