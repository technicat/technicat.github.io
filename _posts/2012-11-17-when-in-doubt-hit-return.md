A while ago, I was discussing how Unity follows standard user interface practices by making all operations available on the menu bar, even operations with keyboard shortcuts (and that’s why they’re called “shortcuts”). And you can always find those shortcuts listed by their corresponding menu bar items.

But to tell you the truth, Apple doesn’t even follow that “standard” practice. I wish they did. Until now, I didn’t realize you can rename a file or folder on the Mac by selecting the file and hitting Return (I really don’t find that intuitive - sure you hit Return to finish renaming a file, but to start?). I’ve been using the other method, selecting the file and then clicking on the filename, which is drives me crazy since half the time that gets interpreted as a double-click and opens the file or folder.

There should be a Rename operation in the right-click context menu or in the File menu, especially since it’s one of the most common file operations. C'mon people, this isn’t Blender. As it is, I had to google for how to rename a Mac file. I find myself resorting to google more and more to figure out how to use a Mac (and hey, the fact that the stuff I’m looking for is posted on blogs and forums indicates I’m not the only confused). There’s something just wrong with that.
