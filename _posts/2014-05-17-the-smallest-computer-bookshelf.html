<p>I&rsquo;m delighted to see there&rsquo;s a public library around the corner from ny new (and by new, I mean old) apartment. This library, however, has the worst computer book section I&rsquo;ve ever seen in a public library.</p>

<p>First of all, how can the C++ Programming book be the thinnest one? And while I&rsquo;m not suggesting any of these books should not be there, consider that this is the entirety of their computer section (that three bookshelf section of the San Mateo library is looking pretty good now).</p>
