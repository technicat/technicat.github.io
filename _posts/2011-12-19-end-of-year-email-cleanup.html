<p>I have a lot of email addresses that I create for different occasions so when I get spam I can deduce where the spammers got my address. It&rsquo;s also handy when those unsubscribe links don&rsquo;t work - I just remove the address from service.</p>

<p>For example, last week I decided to remove resume@technicat.com from service, again. It&rsquo;s only listed on a resume I created several years ago - now it&rsquo;s in a bunch of recruiter databases and I get hilarious or irritating emails (depending on my mood) in the nature of &ldquo;Your resume looks great, can you send me your resume&rdquo; and even &ldquo;what is your email.&rdquo; A recruiter I had an email exchange with a month ago just reintroduced himself: &ldquo;Hi, may name is&hellip;&rdquo; And there are always the &ldquo;Do you know someone who could fill this position?&rdquo; Sure, just give me ten percent of his or her salary.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m more sad that I have to remove comicon@technicat.com. I don&rsquo;t get too much junk email from comicon, compared to other conventions, but Random House Audio is one of those that just don&rsquo;t want to go away. I&rsquo;ve hit the unsubscribe link on each of their messages - now they just mention they have an unsubscribe page and you have to guess where it its:</p>
