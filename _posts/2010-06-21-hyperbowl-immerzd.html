<p>I saw <a href="http://www.immerz.com/">Immerz</a> at E3 last week and gave it a try. It&rsquo;s primarily designed to work with FPS games, but since it plugs into anything with an audio output jack, I whipped out my iPad and tried with <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/hyperbowl/id344209253?mt=8">HyperBowl</a>. It worked surprisingly well - you can feel the rumbling on your chest as the ball rolls, and the 3D audio sources (including the pins!) sound great.</p>

<p>I wonder how well it would work with the footstep and suspense sounds in <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/fugu-maze/id295808255?mt=8">Fugu Maze</a>. Now I&rsquo;m thinking about putting in a heartbeat sound&hellip;</p>
