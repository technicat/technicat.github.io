<p>The latest submission of <a href="http://hyperbowl3d.com/">HyperBowl</a> to the Mac App store got rejected due to a bug when switching from fullscreen to windowed mode (reportedly the cursor gets stuck in the screen corner, but I haven&rsquo;t reproduced it). My expedient solution is to just remove fullscreen mode. I didn&rsquo;t really like worrying about the squash and stretch issue, anyway (or so I rationalize).</p>

<p>Unity lacks an option to disable fullscreen, but it&rsquo;s not hard to do remove it in a MacOSX build (you just have to do it after every build). Just invoke a Show Package on the app to find the MainMenu nib file:</p>

<p><a href="http://itshardtofondlepenguins.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Screen-shot-2011-03-27-at-2.29.45-PM.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4391" title="Screen shot 2011-03-27 at 2.29.45 PM" src="http://itshardtofondlepenguins.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Screen-shot-2011-03-27-at-2.29.45-PM.png" alt="" width="240" height="281"/></a></p>

<p>and then in XCode remove the fullscreen menu item (select, then perform a Cut in the Edit menu):</p>

<p><a href="http://itshardtofondlepenguins.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Screen-shot-2011-03-27-at-2.30.42-PM.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4392" title="Screen shot 2011-03-27 at 2.30.42 PM" src="http://itshardtofondlepenguins.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Screen-shot-2011-03-27-at-2.30.42-PM.png" alt="" width="758" height="213"/></a></p>

<p>This still leaves the &ldquo;Windowed&rdquo; checkbox in the resolution dialog, so if you&rsquo;re enabled that dialog, you&rsquo;ll probably want to edit that nib file, also.</p>
