<p>For a measly $20 a year, I get to be a card-carrying member of the <a href="http://aclu.org/">ACLU</a> (and unlike <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Dukakis">Dukakis</a>, I&rsquo;m not embarrassed to admit it). But I wish they&rsquo;d take it easy with their mailings. I got a 2009 membership renewal notice last week urging me to renew now to save them the cost of mailing additional reminders in the next few months. You know what would also save them the cost of the mailings? Not sending them. (And since privacy is one of their issues, they could do better than their opt-out mail list sharing policy) Another charity I regularly donate to, <a href="http://doctorswithoutborders.org/">Doctors Without Borders</a>, will sometimes send me several mailings in a few weeks. Usually, I keep the first one around intending to send in a donation, and then when they pile up, I throw the whole thing out during my weekend cleaning. After all, they&rsquo;re going to send another one, right?</p>

<p>But nothing beatsÂ  <a href="http://www.symantec.com/">Symantec</a>&rsquo;s Norton product for pure annoyance (well, besides spam, of course). Besides a confusing user interface (I can&rsquo;t even tell what the name of the product is - from web searches I gather it&rsquo;s probably Norton 360 or Norton 2009 or something like that, but on the screen I just see there are two products apparently glommed into one - Norton Total Protection which apparently isn&rsquo;t total because there&rsquo;s a separate panel for Norton Internet), it has a 30-day <a href="http://forums.techguy.org/general-security/691650-disabling-incessant-renewal-reminders-norton.html">countdown for subscription renewal</a>. It sounds like (but doesn&rsquo;t clearly state) that the renewal is only required for getting updates of virus definitions and such, but after seeing a popup every day saying &ldquo;You have 30 days left&hellip;&rdquo;, &ldquo;You have 29 days left&hellip;.&rdquo;, &ldquo;You have 28 days left&hellip;&rdquo;, I just followed the most common advice on the web for turning this off and removed Norton entirely.</p>

<p>I guess when you have a pilot fish relationship with the <a href="http://sec-soapbox.blogspot.com/2007/03/why-is-windows-insecure.html">notoriously insecure</a> shark that is Windows, you can just rest your business on OEM installations for years and years, not bother to improve the user interface, and keep all your <a href="http://blogs.pcworld.com/staffblog/archives/001366.html">annoying habits</a>.</p>
