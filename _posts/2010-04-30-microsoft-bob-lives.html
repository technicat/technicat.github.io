<p>Popups have evolved from just popping up to jumping in front of you. In some cases, they are &ldquo;nice&rdquo; enough to only pop up when your mouse moves over them (the evil twin of tooltips), in which case you end up playing a browser game called Avoid-the-Hotspot. Here&rsquo;s one that jumps in over the reading area from the right. Surprise!</p>

<p><a href="http://itshardtofondlepenguins.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/Screen-shot-2010-04-30-at-12.51.34-AM1.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3384" title="Screen shot 2010-04-30 at 12.51.34 AM" src="http://itshardtofondlepenguins.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/Screen-shot-2010-04-30-at-12.51.34-AM1.png" alt="" width="446" height="136"/></a></p>

<p>Worse are the ones that abandon restraint and just say &ldquo;Here I am. Look at me! Look at me! It&rsquo;s time for my close-up, Mr. Demille!&rdquo; I ran into this popup while scrolling down and trying to read the article - and of course it pops up right where you&rsquo;re trying to read. It&rsquo;s as if those ubiquitous television badges (reminding you that you&rsquo;re watching &ldquo;Syfy&rdquo;!) were placed in the center of the TV screen instead of the corner.</p>

<p>From an advertising perspective I suppose it might be considered effective in that you can&rsquo;t ignore it (you could say the same about a punch in the face), but I make a point of not &ldquo;sharing&rdquo; those sites via Twitter or whatever - I&rsquo;m not going to inflict that on anyone else.</p>
