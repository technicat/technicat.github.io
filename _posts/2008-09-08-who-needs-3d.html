<p>Travelling down memory lane, I found I&rsquo;m able to play some old interactive fiction titles, a la <a href="http://www.infocom-if.org/">Infocom</a>, like this <a href="http://www.brasslantern.org/community/history/adams.html">Scott Adams</a> adventure (check out his <a href="http://jerz.setonhill.edu/if/adams/scottspeaks.html">lecture</a>), by installing <a href="http://www.logicalshift.co.uk/unix/zoom/">Zoom</a> and downloading <a href="http://www.wurb.com/if/platform/1">ZCode</a> games from the <a href="http://www.ifarchive.org/">Interactive Fiction Archive</a>. I&rsquo;m no better at text adventures than 3D games, but at least the resulting death is less gory.</p>

<p>One of these days, I might try out <a href="http://www.inform-fiction.org">Inform</a>, a natural language based system for designing interactive fiction. It looks pretty slick.</p>
