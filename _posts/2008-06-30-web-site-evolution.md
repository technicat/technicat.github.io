The[Internet Archive](http://archive.org/) lets go you go back in time (via their Wayback Machine) to see old snapshots of a web site. Consider the humble beginnings of [Technicat](http://www.technicat.com/), with this version back in 1999:

Five years later, I ditched the animated GIF kitties and went with a programmer-oriented setup, using an open source content management system called [Forrest](http://forrest.apache.org/) which adheres strictly to [W3C](http://w3.org/) standards, and added some essays on software development.

And then last year, I spiced it up with some graphics created by [WordsEye](http://www.wordseye.com/), a new company logo designed by [Shane Nakamura Designs](http://www.shanenakamuradesigns.com/), and tweaked the look after seeing the [CSS Zen Garden](http://www.csszengarden.com/).

Only ten years in the making!
