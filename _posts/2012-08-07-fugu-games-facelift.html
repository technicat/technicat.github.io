<p>I went into PHP mode again this weekend and added icons to table of apps. The icons do make it prettier.</p>

<p>But I decided I really need to just redo the page, again, since it just doesn&rsquo;t look good when viewed from a small screen, especially in portrait orientation, and I need a &ldquo;more games&rdquo; type of presentation for linking from apps. So I reuse the icon table, and I have alternate views for showing apps in different appstores (nook, kindle, google plah). It still links to the old table - I like to see those bar charts!</p>
