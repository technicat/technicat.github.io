When I purchased Xamarin (or rented, as it’s a subscription) last year, I had visions of cross-platform mobile development, like Unity, but for application apps (app-apps?)

I didn’t get very far last year, just trying out some sample Android apps, partly the cross-platform aspect really only encompassed any reusable non-UI code, as Xamarin uses the native platform UI. Xamarin Forms, introduced just a few months ago, is intended to take care of that, providing a cross-platform way to create the UI. But it’s pretty new, so I wasn’t surprised I ran into stumbling blocks like being unable to build a sample app after moving it, and unable to build an Android version of an app although the iOS version worked fine.

But, finally, after the latest Xamarin update, success! I was able to build both the Android and iOS versions of a sample tip calculator and deploy them on Google Play and the App Store (under the name Fugu Tips). It’s not the most exciting app, especially after mostly with Unity games the last several years, but it works (and it works better than some, like that one I found which displays NaN in some situations!)

Anyway, now it’s time to start messing with it. I’ve got a few ideas, like some feedback on your generosity (a resounding boo! if you drag that slider too low), or some presets in addition to the slider, or even some geolocation-based help on tipping properly in other areas of the world (it’ll be easy in some Asian countries - a big fat zero).
