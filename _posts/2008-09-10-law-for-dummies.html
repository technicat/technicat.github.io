<p>I saw mention on the <a href="http://igda.org/">IGDA</a> forums (and just the other day in <a href="http://ocmetro.com/">OC Metro</a> magazine) of the recent <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2008/08/07/BAUH12716R.DTL&amp;tsp=1">California Supreme Court decision</a> upholding the California law banning <a href="http://www.employlaw.com/noncompete.htm">non-compete agreements.</a></p>

<p>I wish I&rsquo;d known of the California statute before - in years past I&rsquo;ve encountered a sneaky version of non-compete agreements at a couple of places - the employment agreements each included a clause stating that if I left for a new job, I&rsquo;d have to report to this company what I was doing at the new employer for six months. Of course, no company, including the ones presenting me with these agreements, would ever hire anyone who was going to do that (although I can&rsquo;t imagine how promising to relay trade secrets would be enforceable).</p>

<p>In each of these cases, I had to listen to the standard idiotic spin (&ldquo;I have to protect my business&rdquo;, and paradoxically, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s for your own protection&rdquo;), but I&rsquo;m also annoyed by the assumption that what you&rsquo;re signing must be valid because it came from a lawyer. The most egregious case I can recall - a mobile game startup formed by Caltech students who gave me an NDA that in its last clause stated they could change the terms of the agreement at any time. I tried appealing to their Caltech intellect, but they just assured me that their lawyer came up with it to protect their company (and then they hung up on me). You know, lawyers can suck, too.<!--more--></p>

<p>For example, one of those report-your-next-employer&rsquo;s-trade-secrets-to-us agreements was presented to me in a California startup. Either the attorney wasn&rsquo;t aware of the non-compete statute or ignored it. I&rsquo;d guess the former, since the contract was terribly written, filled with grammatical errors and sloppily written clauses that duplicated each other yet differed. And he was as an immigration attorney. But I&rsquo;ve also seen an attorney posting in a forum who was surprised by mention of what I thought was a fairly well-known California labor law, and his posting signature described him as a California attorney specializing in labor law!</p>

<p>And lawyers don&rsquo;t do much to warn you about bad lawyers. Google for <a href="http://legalzoom.com/">LegalZoom</a>, for example, and you&rsquo;ll find plenty of lawyers blogging about the dangers of of using such a cheap service to get standard legal forms instead of ponying up for a real attorney. But I was presented with a contract by an attorney at a Bay Area startup only to find that same contract as a sample on the web (and when I objected to the indemnification clause, that attorney had to look up &ldquo;indemnify&rdquo; in her pocket dictionary) And when I was involved in a domain name dispute and explained to my attorney an opinion based on the registar&rsquo;s dispute resolution policy, it took her three days to get back to me with the same opinion citing just the web page I gave her. You may well be paying an attorney to do the same work you would have done, only slower and for a few hundred dollars an hour.</p>

<p>The closest I&rsquo;ve seen to a warning that you should take legal advice with a grain of salt is <a href="http://gameattorney.com/blog/?p=70">Tom Buscaglia&rsquo;s article</a>, first published on <a href="http://gamasutra.com/">Gamasutra</a>. But even there, he lengthily discusses how you should &ldquo;train&rdquo; your lawyer - despite calling it a &ldquo;touchy&rdquo; subject, he doesn&rsquo;t come out and say lawyers may be unsuitable or incompetent or dismissed. Much of the article does remind me of a book on business contracts written by a New England attorney several years ago (I wish I remembered it, I liked that book a lot) that displayed as examples several contracts from heavyweight companies like DEC (the book was that old) which probably lost lot of business opportunities, as they were written with a ridiculous degree of agressiveness. As Tom&rsquo;s article suggests, you can fix that problem by explaining to your attorney, say, you really want to hire people who aren&rsquo;t so desperate for a job that they&rsquo;ll sign anything.</p>

<p>However, Tom&rsquo;s article only hints at but doesn&rsquo;t really dig into a problem that&rsquo;s much harder to solveÂ  - an attorney that&rsquo;s not familiar with your business. Familiarity with the game business is one aspect of that (the last attorney I used remarked on &ldquo;new-fangled video games&rdquo;), but the more widespread problem in software and not just video games is familiarity with software IP issues. Tom&rsquo;s article starts off citing a case where a vendor lost his client&rsquo;s business because the vendor&rsquo;s attorney didn&rsquo;t agree to state the middleware didn&rsquo;t contain any <a href="http://opensource.org/">open source</a> code. Well, I bet that engine did include open source code and it was probably OK. It&rsquo;s hard to find any significant software these days that doesn&rsquo;t at least link with an open source library, some of which are de-facto implementations in their category -<a href="http://curl.haxx.se/"> libcurl</a>, <a href="http://openssl.org/">openssl</a>, <a href="http://ljg.org/">libjpeg</a>, <a href="http://libpng.org/">libpng</a>, <a href="http://zlib.net/">zlib</a>, <a href="http://freeimage.org/">freeimage</a>, <a href="http://freetype.org/">freetyp</a>e, <a href="http://speex.org/">speex</a>&hellip;just look at all the DLL&rsquo;s that come with your app or game. Considering that these libraries generally have open source licenses that do not restrict commercial usage and distribution, like the <a href="http://opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php">MIT license</a>, it would be unwise to attempt writing everything from scratch or to buy expensive and/or inferior alternatives. Come to think of it, the last product I worked on that didn&rsquo;t incorporate any open source library was in 1995. And I might be wrong about that one.</p>

<p>Yet it seems many, probably most, attorneys assume &ldquo;open source&rdquo; means <a href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html">GPL</a> or something similarly restrictive and problematic. Tom may have the same conception since he says of the engine &ldquo;the inclusion of any open source of code would significantly impair the commercial viability of their product&rdquo;, which is a vague use of the term &ldquo;inclusion&rdquo; (in the main source code of the engine? included as a dynamically-linked library? included as a statically linked library?) and not really a correct characterization of the term &ldquo;open source&rdquo;. So Tom may have actually forced his client away from their first-choice engine if he had used overly broad language and the opposing attorney recognized it.</p>

<p>But if he made that mistake, it&rsquo;s probably more common that not. It&rsquo;s hard for me to imagine that anyone who doesn&rsquo;t write programs, even an IP attorney, would really understand how software is put together. One client gave me a contract that said I would sublicense any third-party components I used in a deliverable to my client without restriction. That didn&rsquo;t really make sense, since if I just use something like Visual C++, I&rsquo;m compiling and linking in third-party code, and I have yet to see any license for any product that says I can sublicense it under any terms I choose. When I said that would just force me to work on-site and only with my client&rsquo;s tools, the attorney said, &ldquo;yes, that&rsquo;s what I meant&rdquo; (right, just like my doctor who told me I had allergies, then checked and saw I had bronchitis, then told me it was bronchitis aggravated by allergies and gave me allergy medicine)</p>

<p>I just looked at the license agreement for <a href="http://codejock.com/">CodeJock Software</a>, which produces a GUI toolkit for Windows - the license looks very carefully and elaborately written, but it includes language saying you cannot &ldquo;use&rdquo; their product with open source software. I assume they mean you can&rsquo;t embed or link their code into your app if you distribute your app under an open source license which requires their code to be opened up, too. But if taken literally, their license makes their product, well, literally unusable - you can&rsquo;t use it with open-source tools (editors, compilers, debuggers, graphics creation?), or you can&rsquo;t use it with open source libraries like the ones I mentioned above which everyone uses? And you can&rsquo;t use it if you distribute your code under an open source license that doesn&rsquo;t compromise their license (if it was written better)?</p>

<p>Perhaps the law profession needs the equivalent of a Hippocratic oath - do no harm. And the conventional advice, &ldquo;consult a lawyer&rdquo;, should be elaborated, &ldquo;consult a good lawyer who knows X&rdquo;.</p>
