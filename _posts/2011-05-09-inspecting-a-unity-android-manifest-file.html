<p>While working with Unity Android, sometimes I wonder what did Unity put in the <a href="http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/manifest-intro.html">manifest file</a> of my app? There&rsquo;s a way to do that without extracting it from the apk file - a copy of the manifest file remains in the project Temp directory after the build, until you quit Unity or close the project.</p>
