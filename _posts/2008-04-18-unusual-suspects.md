Long ago, I gave up on hitting the pavement to find consulting/contract work. I rely on referrals from colleagues, and reliably, every year, projects come in.

This is my cue to write a book entitled “Secrets to Networking Success” or “Networking for Dummies”, but to be honest, although before turning to full-time self-employment I had twelve salaried jobs, nearly all of my job and contract referrals can be traced to just one, a long-expired venture called Nichimen Graphics.

How can that be? What’s so special about that one company? Or what’s so lame about all the others?<!--more-->

For starters, Nichimen Graphics had a collegial atmosphere. Sure, there were cliques, but as long as the cliques were connected, everyone was connected. While there (and afterwards), I played basketball and soccer in the afternoon, joined Friday night poker games, evening work-gossip sessions over bottles of Glenlivet. Note this wasn’t encouraged by management - it just happened.

Part of this can be attributed to Southern California. During my interview, the sole QA person told me he liked to surf in the morning before work. Another part is old-school programmer culture. After joining, I spent hours-long lunches at sidewalk French cafes (the strip mall version) arguing politics and programming while checking out the LA hotties strolling by (this is not an essay on how to run a productive company, by the way).

Besides culture, the company had a core product with a lifetime spanning several incarnations of the company and a loyal following all that time. So over the years, customers became employees, employees became customers, and while there were strong and differing opinions on how the product should evolve, all were tied to that hub.

And there was the industry. Computer graphics is a gossipy, volatile industry with a strong presence in LA, with a natural tie-in to the similarly-cultured game business. So there are get-togethers at Siggraph, GDC, art shows, an email list (admittedly not that active) for this group of (self-titled) “unusual suspects”.

So colleagues start or move to new ventures that have cool, urgent projects - they call me to help out, five-minute informal interview and I’m in, project is completed, those colleagues move on, the cycle repeats itself. I get repeat business - not at the same companies, but referred by the same colleagues. To see how a group has spread out from one company in a single industry, see this list of [game credits](http://www.unsuspects.com/) by that group (a list of movie credits would be even more impressive)

Contrast this with my other past industries - my old Silicon Valley employers were absorbed by larger entities and those colleagues, burned by the dot-com bust, are occupying cubicles and playing it safe. My old corporate, defense and government contract employers had Five Year March projects or projects with no end in sight - there’s no incentive to bring in people like me to help, or if there is, they go through another big contractor. (I was once an employee of a subcontractor of a subcontractor on a project managed by my employer) For most of those colleagues, the last time I saw them was at my farewell lunch (once they even forgot to invite me).

So is there a useful point to this? Well, at the risk of having started a thought I can’t finish, it seems establishing a useful network is like starting a successful company - there’s no magic formula. Sometimes you just get lucky. But you may have a better chance if you seek out good group of people who are motivated enough to start or join interesting projects that may eventually need you. And remember to return the favor!
