> wow. &nbsp;I just discovered that archive.org has a copy of the old **[spiraloid digital sculpting forum](http://web.archive.org/web/20040212080014/http://cube.phlatt.net/forums/spiraloid/index.php)** I started back in 2001, links art and all. &nbsp;You can see Ofer and I talking about zbrush, subdivs vs nurb arguments. &nbsp;wow. &nbsp;the names of the members.. &nbsp;thought this was all lost to bitrot. &nbsp;neat.
