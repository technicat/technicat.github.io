My upgrade from MacOSX Tiger to Leopard went swimmingly compared to my Windows XP to Vista upgrade - slower, crashes frequently, lost compatibility with several applications, and lost support for a Microsoft codec! (Microsoft ADPCM 2, which turned out to be used for some training videos I wanted to view) Calling Vista an upgrade is stretching the term.

But I did have one annoying problem with Leopard - after upgrading drivers from the Epson site for my CX8400 color printer, it just started spitting out piles of mostly blank but partly garbaged pages. That’s what I get for buying Mac peripherals at Office Depot instead of the Apple Store.

Web searches turned up a solution, not on the Epson or Apple sites, but on [FixYa](http://www.fixya.com/). Looks like a pretty useful site, browsing around I also found tips on another problem I have - how to fix my Toshiba laptop screen after I’d dropped it on parking lot cement.

I was even tempted to join [FixYa](http://www.fixya.com/) as an “expert” in the hopes of earning sweatshop wages for contributing helpful solutions, but once again I was displeased by the overly broad indemnification clause for the Experts terms of service, more onerous than the reasonably stated one for regular users of the site - limited to violations of the terms of service. Just as well - all the Google Adsense dollars, Epinions royalties, and various affiliate programs I’ve joined over the years add up to perhaps one hour of my consulting time.

Now, let’s see if it I can find a fix for my vacuum cleaner…
