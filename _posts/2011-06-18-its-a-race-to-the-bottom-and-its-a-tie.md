I’m starting to feel like a social outcast by pricing [HyperBowl on the App Store](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/hyperbowl/id344209253?mt=8) at $2.99. Recent web reviews have been complimentary but have phrases like “considering it’s $2.99…” (the same site also said a $.99 app was decent but is it worth $.99? ) At E3, someone I demoed HyperBowl to voiced surprise that I was pricing at $2.99. Then again, he claimed he had Angry Birds success after only paying a developer $5000.

Actually, I’ve found $2.99 is more or less the revenue-maximizing price point for HyperBowl. $3.99 brings in about the same, maybe a bit more, but somehow $2.99 feels right (paradoxically, I might feel more justified in charging more if I dropped support for non-HD devices). My original plan was to charge $4.99 after I finished including all six of the original lanes, but I chickened out after one day of zero sales. I’ve also charged $1.99 and $.99 for a few weeks at a time, but the increase in sales units doesn’t compensate for the decrease in price. Perhaps this is short-sighted and I’m targeting a local maximum, but staying at $.99 in the hopes of hitting a home run seems desperate, and I feel better about charging what seems fair to me. On the other hand, I didn’t even try to charge more than $.99 for the [ad-free version of HyperBowl on the Android Market](https://market.android.com/details?id=com.technicat.HyperBowlPro). But maybe I should - I was surprised to see some users of the [ad-supported version](https://market.android.com/details?id=com.technicat.HyperBowl) did upgrade.

I got some perspective a few weeks ago during lunch with a musician friend who is selling her music on iTunes. She thought my app sales were great in comparison. So I guess there’s further down to go.
