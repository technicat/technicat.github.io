<p>I have some fond memories of Baltimore, where I worked on space telescopes and submarine simulators, was introduced to crab cakes and the bars of Fells Point, got my masters degree and bailed out of a PhD program at Johns Hopkins. So, despite my turn away from academia, I&rsquo;m pleased to see a course on <a href="http://interfacedesignforgames.blogspot.com/2010/01/week-1.html">Interface Design for Games</a> at the University of Baltimore listing my <a href="http://technicat.com/writing/ui.html">essay on UI design</a>.Â  This is the second time I&rsquo;ve seen one my essays used in a course (the other one is on <a href="http://technicat.com/writing/programming.html">programming habits</a> ) - if this keeps up, maybe I&rsquo;ll put together a book!</p>
