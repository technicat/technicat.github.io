<p>I&rsquo;m playing around with the path feature of the google static maps API, entering all of my workplaces (including clients on contract work). The line starts from Dallas to Cambridge to Baltimore back to Cambridge to LA then the Bay Area then back to Southern California with a contract in Honolulu and now finally to my current stint in Hong Kong.</p>

<p>The path is a little hard to see with the satellite view, but I think it&rsquo;s just tool cool not to use.</p>
