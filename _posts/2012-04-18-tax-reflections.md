Tax season is a time for introspection. There’s nothing like going over the previous year’s receipts, bills, credit card and bank statements to reassess how you’re living. After dropping off my payment at the post office last night (which made me wonder why I bothered e-filing and then waiting all day for it be accepted), here are a few observations about my 2011:

- I spent a lot on take-out.
- While on a contract, a lot of it is In-n-Out and Five Guys.
- That’s probably why my doctor lectured me on cholesterol.
- My cholesterol pills have continued to go up in price, even when I switched to generics.
- Apple hardware stayed at the same price. At least it got more powerful.
- The Target card really helps out.
- Moving to a no-sales-tax state would help even more.
- I should have charged more on my last contract.
- I buy only a few computer books a year, now, compared to before, which&nbsp;explains why most of the books on my shelf are over ten years old.
- I donated a lot of old computer books to the public library (OSF/Motif Programming Reference, anyone?)
- Comic conventions are a bargain compared to graphics, software and game development conventions.
- I “buy” a lot of free apps, very few paid ones, no in-app purchases.
- Ditto for my customers, apparently.
- Barnes and Noble gave me more paid sales than Amazon.
- Both did better than the Android Market.
- But some are still worse (Handster and some others I won’t even bother to name)
- And Apple did better than all.
- Except the Mac App Store.
- I bought a lot of Unity plugins.
- I made some money selling on the Unity Asset Store.
- I spent that money on the Unity Asset Store.
- But I spent way more on Unity itself (Android Pro)
- I bought a few digital tunes (from my music friends)
- I bought a few ebooks (from my author friends)
- I bought and rented a lot of digital video, mostly on my PS3, mostly favorite TV shows (Breaking Bad, Eureka…)
- I rented a lot from Redbox, less so after they raised the prices from $.99.
- And I still bought quite a few DVD’s and BD’s.
Now I’m going to finish my Unity build, browse the Asset Store, then watch a video and read an ebook before bed. Looks like this year will be much like the last. And I could really use a double-double with cheese.
