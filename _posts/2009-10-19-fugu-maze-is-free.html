<p>Despite ranking as my sales leader, I made <a href="http://itunes.com/app/fugumaze">Fugu Maze</a> free, yesterday.
</p><ul><li>Although it&rsquo;s my top seller, the sales still aren&rsquo;t that great.</li>
	<li>It started out as a free app last year and did really well (20,000 in the first week)</li>
	<li>I don&rsquo;t want to deal with the promo codes, anymore (handing them out on toucharcade is like being surrounded by street urchins)</li>
	<li>I want to concentrate on driving revenue to my <a href="http://itunes.com/app/hyperbowlclassic">HyperBowl</a> apps.</li>
</ul>
That last tactic is of dubious effectiveness - the problem with free apps is that they attract &ldquo;customers&rdquo; who don&rsquo;t pay for apps (and frankly, you get a better class of review from paying customers). However, dropping the price of an app is one method to gain some visibility (so starting at $1.99 and then dropping to $.99 might be a good strategy). Within a few hours of the price change (which took effect nearly instantly on the App Store), googling revealed several alerts on various sites. I was surprised to see that many don&rsquo;t just reprint the App Store description - they paraphrase or slightly rewrite it. This one from <a href="http://poptechnews.com/price-drop-fugu-maze-games.html">poptechnews</a> is bizarre:

But once you look at the original description, it appears to be a classic case of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_translation">machine translation</a>.
