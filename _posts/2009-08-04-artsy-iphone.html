<p>The ragdoll is a fairly modern game engine feature that is just dying to be used (I remember on Darkwatch the game designers went nuts with them) and isÂ  surprisingly effective (look at Ragdoll Kung-Fu). Ragdoll Blaster combines ragdolls with a neat visual style. Here&rsquo;s a screenshot from Ragdoll Blaster Lite.</p>

<p>Also using a hand-drawn style is a nifty iPhone app called Trace. Here you actually sketch the surface for your character to move along. Reminds me of Kid Pix, but adding gameplay!</p>
