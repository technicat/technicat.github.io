I decided to check out the competition for my [HyperBowl](http://hyperbowl3d.com/) games on the App Store - a search for “bowling” returns over 100 apps! But with over 100,000 apps on the store total, I guess I was expecting worse. I tried out a few - here’s a sampler:

300 Bowl. It’s in German.

Flick Bowling has been on the App Store a long time and is a typically polished FreeVerse product.

Galactic Bowl is very slick with some fancy character animation (possibly accounting for some long level-load times). It’s priced accordingly as one of the more expensive bowling apps.

Downhill Bowling is Unity-based bowling game (the only other one I know of besides mine is Zombie Bowling)

Malibu Bowl offers a coconut as a bowling ball.

Action Bowling.

And then there are my two HyperBowl lanes, [HyperBowl Classic](http://itunes.com/app/hyperbowlclassic) and [HyperBowl Rome](http://itunes.com/app/hyperbowlrome). And the free [FuguBowl](http://itunes.com/app/fugubowl).
