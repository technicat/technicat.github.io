Overall, I like developing for Android, but I don’t like depending on AdMob for revenue (maybe I should try Mobclix, but I read some weird clause that seemed to say if you didn’t make enough money, it would be turned back into ad money). It doesn’t pay well, compared to iAds - just [Fugu Bowl](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/fugubowl/id297032758) on iOS brings in more than all my Android apps combined. And now that I’ve started pushing out more iAd-supported iOS apps, I’m earning ten times as much from iAds as AdMob.

Then there are the upgrades. The AdMob home page kept urging me to “upgrade” my login to use my Google login to access new features. Now, instead of logging in immediately, I have to click on extra button to bring up another login page. And since I have a separate Google account for all my ad stuff, I either have to log out of my other Google account or switch browsers (which is what I do - now I have Safari running just to view my AdMob account). And those new features they promised? Haven’t seen them.

Not having learned my lesson, I succumbed to another “upgrade” recommendation this morning, for my house ads. Before, I thought the house ad feature was pretty cool - anytime one of my apps couldn’t retrieve a paying ad, it would serve up one of my house ads so at least I could cross-promote. Now, for any of the house ads to appear, I have to specify a campaign duration, target impressions…forget about it.

I did make one upgrade that I don’t regret. I switched all my AdMob apps over from the [free plugin](http://forum.unity3d.com/threads/77568-AdMob-plugin-that-works-in-Unity-3.2) available on the Unity forum to the new one available from [Prime31](http://prime31.com/). The setup is way easier - no more editing and building Java code! And I think I’ll have an easier time combining it with the [OpenFeint plugin](http://forum.unity3d.com/threads/77546-OpenFeint-plugin-that-works-in-Unity-3.2) I’m using for [HyperBowl](https://market.android.com/details?id=com.technicat.HyperBowlPro).
