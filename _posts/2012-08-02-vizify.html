<p>There&rsquo;s a big difference between having a cool idea and actually implementing it. Even before LinkedIn showed up, what I really wanted was a graphical view of my web sites. I&rsquo;m surprised it took this long, but Vizify does pretty much what I was thinking of. It works pretty well, scales the presentation to fit your web page and work fine on an iPad. It only shows information, optionally, from twitter, LinkedIn, Facebook and foursquare, but I expect they will expand it&rsquo;s reach (like about.me).</p>
