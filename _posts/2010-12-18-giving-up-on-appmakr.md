Well, I had a good run with [AppMakr](http://appmakr.com/), starting out with two accepted apps, [Unity Feed](http://itunes.apple.com/app/unity-feed/id400855804?mt=8) and [Blue Mars News](http://itunes.apple.com/app/blue-mars-news/id403084728?mt=8), but then Apple rejected my “soup of the day” app for my favorite local [French sandwich shop](http://lapetitebaguette.com/) as violating their prohibition on primarily-marketing apps, and today they rejected my collection of [gamasutra](http://gamasutra.com/) RSS feeds. I wouldn’t say the last two apps were a waste of time, since I use them daily to check for lunch specials and game news, but I don’t think I’ll spend any more time with AppMakr, since the reason for the last rejection (“content aggregator”) seems to count out any app created with it.

> We’ve completed the review of your app but cannot post this version to the App Store because it is only a content aggregator and provides a limited set of features and functionality to users. Such apps do not comply with the App Store Review Guidelines : 12.3 Apps that are simply web clippings, content aggregators, or a collection of links, may be rejected We encourage you to review your app concept and evaluate whether you can incorporate additional features to enhance the user experience. Or, if you would like to share the app with friends and family, we recommend reviewing the Ad Hoc distribution method on the Distribution tab of the iOS Provisioning Portal for details on distributing this application among a small group of people of your choosing. Alternatively, you may wish to consider a building a web app using HTML5. HTML5 is the major new version of HTML and enables audio and video to play natively in the browser without requiring proprietary plug-ins. Using HTML5, web apps look and behave like native iPhone and iPad applications, and using HTML5’s Offline Application Cache, your web applications work even when the device is offline. With web apps, you have flexibility to deliver as much or as little functionality as you desire.

I find it interesting that in both rejections they pushed HTML5 web apps as an alternative (sure, if I feel like setting up a content aggregator web server as a substitute for this app), and in this latest rejection they also mention ad-hoc distribution as an alternative (I’m tempted to do that for the customers of the French sandwich shop, but I don’t really want to be in the ad-hoc installation support business)[![](http://itshardtofondlepenguins.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/IMG_0340.png "IMG\_0340")](http://itshardtofondlepenguins.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/IMG_0340.png)
