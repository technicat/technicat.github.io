<p>I started this blog site a few months ago because my sister suggested it and I remember reading a while back in a Tennessee Williams short story collection that he wrote a story every morning before trudging to his day job. And I figured, rather than bore everyone (including myself) with tales of my half-finished screenplay, I should make an effort to write once a day, at least as an exercise.

But as with my Wii Fit, where the spirit is willing, the self-discipline is weak. I&rsquo;ve blogged almost daily, but often I cheat. One of my fallbacks is to post a <a href="http://www.wordseye.com/">WordsEye</a> graphic (at least it the scenes are generated from text). Another is to just write a few words about another site and link to it (the parasitic method). And finally, the Letterman technique - a top ten list (or Covey technique, if you can only come up with seven).

Since one of my favorite shows, <a href="http://www.scifi.com/eureka/">Eureka</a>, just came back on the air, and it&rsquo;s a weekend so most blog readers should be doing something more interesting than reading blogs (that&rsquo;s what work time is for), here&rsquo;s my top ten current hour-long series:
</p><ol><li>Battlestar Galactica (SciFi) - it&rsquo;s been uneven the last couple of years, but I still can&rsquo;t miss an episode</li>
	<li>Eureka (SciFi) - I&rsquo;m surprised it&rsquo;s still on, never heard anyone talk about it, but it&rsquo;s good science with good characters</li>
	<li>The Closer (TNT) - Kera Sedgwick plays possibly the single best character on TV right now</li>
	<li>Damages (FX) - amazing that a show with barely any humor can be so compelling, and that they can add a twist to every episode</li>
	<li>Burn Notice (USA) - great to see Bruce Cambell on a regular show again, and Gabrielle Anwar, too!</li>
	<li>Reaper (WB) - Kevin Smith&rsquo;s slackers with day jobs in retail and moonlighting for the devil, an antidote to McG&rsquo;s Chuck</li>
	<li>Lost (ABC) - see The Shield</li>
	<li>Monk (USA) - perhaps the funniest character on television, and great ensemble chemistry</li>
	<li>The Shield (FX)- seems like it&rsquo;s gone one season too long, but I still have to know how it ends</li>
	<li>Psych (USA) - this has started growing on me, but it&rsquo;s up for grabs (In Plain Sight, Saving Grace, The Sarah Connor Chronicles, Stargate Atlantis&hellip;) Forgot, Mad Men.</li>
</ol>
Thank the Lords of Kobol for basic cable!
