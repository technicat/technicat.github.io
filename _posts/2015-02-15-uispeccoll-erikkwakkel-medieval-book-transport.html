What they share is not just their old age (they are all medieval), but also the purpose for which they were made: to transport a book from A to B. The actual reason for transporting books in these objects varied considerably. The wraps are late-medieval girdle books, which were hanged from the owner’s belt by the knot. The text inside - which was often of legal or religious nature - could be consulted quickly and easily: just unwrap it and read. The box (and the ninth-century book inside) had a more exotic use: the package functioned as a charm for good luck on the battlefield, where it was carried in front of the troops by a monk. The satchel, which also dates from the ninth century, was just a bag to transport a book while on the go - it was popular among monks. Read more about these fascinating devices in my blog post “Medieval Books on the Go” (here).   </p><p>Pics -  Wrap at top:  Stockholm, Royal Library (16th century, <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/25300312@N08/sets/72157625022673359/?utm_content=bufferc47ce&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter.com&amp;utm_campaign=buffer">source</a>); Wrap below it: Yale, Beinecke Library, MS 84 (15th century, <a href="http://brbl-dl.library.yale.edu/vufind/Record/3531430">source</a>); Box:  Dublin, Royal, Irish Academy, D ii 3 (8th/9th century, <a href="http://www.isos.dias.ie/english/index.html">source</a>); Satchel: Dublin, Trinity, College, MS 52 (Book of Armagh, 9th century, <a href="http://www.tcd.ie/Library/about/exhibitions/preservation-conservation/howcanyouhelp.php">source</a>).</p></blockquote><p>Fantastic.</p></blockquote>
