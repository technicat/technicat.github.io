When I stopped in Korea on my way back from Hong Kong, I bought a pile of Korean language books with the crazy thought that I might learn the language in my three days there. I guess I was filled with optimism dealing with a language that has an alphabet, after spending six months trying to memorize enough Chinese characters to order from the food court.

My optimism wasn’t totally misplaced. The Korean writing system looks so designed it looks like a science fiction writer came up wit it, and it really was a commissioned design from a few hundred years ago (next, I want to learn Klingon and see how the languages compare). There are letters for consonants and vowels, and they are visually grouped in syllables. And there’s none of that crazy tonal stuff that makes Chinese even harder. But pronunciation is still the challenge, so an app has an advantage over books. This TenguGo Hangul app in particular is more useful in teaching the writing system than all the books I bought.
