<p>I generally don&rsquo;t like to see ads in apps (or anywhere else for that matter), but in a few cases it&rsquo;s not too distracting, e.g. the NY Times app on the iPad. And since Apple incorporated iAds into its one-stop publishing framework, I figured I&rsquo;d give the iAds plugin from <a href="http://prime31.com/">Prime 31 Studios</a> a try (testing not just iAds and the plugin, but also the combination with <a href="http://unity3d.com/">Unity 3.0</a> and the HD resolutions on the 4th-gen iPhone and iPod touch). I decided it might look OK on <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/fugubowl/id297032758?mt=8">Fugu Bowl</a>, since there&rsquo;s plenty of space on the bottom and top, and it&rsquo;s a free app (actually, my most downloaded app)</p>

<p>I was a bit worried, since during testing I didn&rsquo;t see any test ads, and the review period was long - maybe because I hadn&rsquo;t specified any exclusion keywords in the ad settings, and the system didn&rsquo;t seem to think I&rsquo;d finished setting it up. Anyway, after excluding &ldquo;weapons&rdquo; (the example used by Apple in its docs), the app was approved,Â  yesterday, and the ad display works. (I never thought I&rsquo;d be relieved to see ads appear in an app!) It doesn&rsquo;t show ads all the time, which I think is nice. You decide.</p>
