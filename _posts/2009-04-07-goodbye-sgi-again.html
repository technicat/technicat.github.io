<p>As an unsatisfied (more accurately, vengeful) former customer of some companies that have run into trouble, recently, like WaMu and Sprint, I&rsquo;ve wondered how companies that have such lousy customer service have not only lasted, but grown (in some cases, big enough to be &ldquo;too big to fail&rdquo;).

In the case of<a href="http://www.mercurynews.com/opinion/ci_12087085"> SGI&rsquo;s bankruptcy</a> (the second one in the last few years), my reaction was genuine surprise that they&rsquo;re still around. When I had to depend on them as a vendor back in 1995-1997 they already seemed determined to fail. Their technology was innovative, the product design was cool and without exception I enjoyed talking with their engineers (many of the really good ones ended up at nVidia). Their machines were far more expensive than the up-and-coming Windows NT workstations and they even charged a lot for memory expansions, and conventional wisdom would have it that they couldn&rsquo;t compete on cost. But while we were moving our product onto Windows NT in anticipation of customer demand there, I was anxious to to just get away from SGI for my own reasons. Some highlights (lowlights):
</p><ul><li>We paid to be part of their Developer Program, which provided valuable assistance, except that they wouldn&rsquo;t take bug reports. Bug reports could only be submitted through the (separately paid) customer support program.</li>
	<li>The customer support program was geared toward their regular content creation users, not developers, and problems could only be reported by phone. Try describing an operating system-specific C linker error with a 3D graphics utility library (GLU) occurring with a foreign function interface in a third-party programming environment and your complicated dynamic-linking workaround over the phone to an engineer who got assigned that duty as an entry-level position, only to have that person swapped with a replacement entry-level engineer who returns a followup call three months later just to hear the problem again and start over.</li>
	<li>SGI created and licensed their 3D API, OpenGL, as an open standard, starting with OpenGL 1.0, yet somehow let Microsoft come out with OpenGL 1.1 first.</li>
	<li>In the meantime, SGI had new platforms running on three different operating systems, Irix 6.2/&frac34;, with some incompatibilities among them. For example, if we linked to the video library on Irix 6.3, that app wouldn&rsquo;t run on the other machines.</li>
	<li>SGI released two new platforms, the O2 and the Octane, before letting us have a unit for testing. We received a &ldquo;skinless&rdquo; O2 after the product launch. Naturally, our biggest customer received a whole bunch of new machines (Octanes) and they proceeded to crash our app. It wasn&rsquo;t helped by the later-recognized 10% processor defect rate they had in those units, or the fact that our sales team had sold them a (generously-titled) &ldquo;beta&rdquo; of our product (if I was paranoid, I&rsquo;d say our sales people and SGI&rsquo;s were ganging up on me for all the unflattering things I said about them - but to be fair, our customer only called me over to yell at me after they yelled at our own sales support guy, who just couldn&rsquo;t take it after some point)</li>
	<li>To combat the impending Windows NT threat, SGI sent a team of three marketers and one engineer to convince us to use their new proprietary API&rsquo;s. (I wondered if that 3-1 ration applied to the whole company) After the three presentations, I pointed out there&rsquo;s no way we would start using new proprietary API&rsquo;s when we still had trouble using their existing standard one (OpenGL). At which they expressed complete sympathy.</li>
	<li>A short while later, one of the SGI higher-ups saw us demo'ing at a trade show on a Windows workstation and immediately sent as an engineer to help. The engineer reproduced our problem and agreed it existed.</li>
	<li>Six months after the release of our product, the field engineer contacted me and reported that our problem was a known problem and had been in SGI&rsquo;s internal bug database all along.</li>
	<li>After I left that job to help form a startup, SGI was still the premier graphics hardware provider, so yet again, we applied for the Developer Program, but I balked at the part of the agreement where they required us to describe our product and what day within the next year it would be released. The program rep was unpersuaded when I pointed out that products are rarely completed within a year and anyway that was business confidential information, especially considering SGI was a competitor with its Alias/Wavefront products, which, by the way, weren&rsquo;t released in less than yearly cycles either. So I resignedly said &ldquo;OK, I guess you can&rsquo;t fight city hall&rdquo; and rather obviously conjured up an improbable release date, whereupon the program rep responded, &ldquo;It would have been easier if you&rsquo;d just given me this information first&rdquo;. Not for the first or last time, I wished for a way to punch someone in the face through the Internet. (telepresence? telepunch?)</li>
</ul>
It&rsquo;s often said (usually by marketing and business types) that great technology doesn&rsquo;t sell itself. Well, you&rsquo;ll never know if you drive away customers with arrogant marketing and lousy customer relations.
