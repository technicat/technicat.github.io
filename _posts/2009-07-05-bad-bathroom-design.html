<p>Since Expo is now defunct, I received a card from the parent Home Depot encouraging me to visit my nearest Home Depot for my remodelling needs. I could use a bathroom remodel (along with a kitchen remodel, new car, etc., etc.) . But check out the bathroom at Hope Depot:</p>

<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2136" title="IMG00406" src="http://itshardtofondlepenguins.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/IMG00406-300x240.jpg" alt="IMG00406" width="300" height="240"/></p>

<p>The hand dryers are placed so that only one is usable at any time. Whoever is using one will be blocking access to both.</p>

<p>Besides just looking stupid, this encourages those miscreants who don&rsquo;t wash their hands after using the toilet. If design is design for functionality, then bathroom design should be design for hygiene (and not just nice tile patterns), especially in this swine flu age. Watching  someone leave a Home Depot bathroom without washing is not the end of the world (unless he&rsquo;s the guy manning the hot dog stand outside), but whenever I visit a coffee shop with no soap in the bathroom, I just order the bottled drink, and when I saw the same at a neighborhood grocery, I changed my mind about the deli counter. And even at a Best Buy recently, when I saw a blue shirt go straight from urinal to the exit, I thought, well, I don&rsquo;t want that guy handing me merchandise or change (you wanna put that cell phone on your ear?)</p>
