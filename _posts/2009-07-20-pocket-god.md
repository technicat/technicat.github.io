An Apple ad moment occurred during dim sum this weekend - everyone pulled out their mobile devices, mostly iPhones (including my iPod touch) with a couple of Blackberries in the mix, and started comparing apps. The favorite was [Pocket God](http://pocketgod.blogspot.com/).

It’s interesting that everyone wasn’t so much playing a game as just playing. No bragging about high scores - just showing each other how to create lightning, start a tidal wave…OK, it sounds cruel, but really, this thing is exploratory fun. You can drag just about anything - change the time of day by dragging the sun, incinerate something by pulling the magnifying glass over it, levitate or launch the pygmies (toward the volcano)…and none of this Game Over buzzkill, just drop more pygmies, birds, sharks to keep things going. For $.99 on the App Store, it’s a deal.
