Someone pointed out this Koi Pond app to me. It’s pretty nice - tapping the screen gets you a nice ripple effect and chases away the fish. And it’s neat to have an app that you can hold in any orientation (look Ma, no HUD!)

I decided to check for fish-screensaverish apps based on the Unity engine. I think this was the first one, Artifishal Life (points for the name!)

And a more recent, more deluxe one, 3D Fish Tank (and it’s apparently more resource-intensive - I had to reboot my iPod touch to get this one started)
