<p><em>Originally written on Epinions in March 2004:</em></p>

<p>I&rsquo;m a latecomer to comic books - I did read a few as a kid, but never had the same sophisticated appreciation for them as, say, Bart Simpson has for Atomic Man. However, I&rsquo;ve paid more attention to them lately as they&rsquo;ve become lucrative fodder for Hollywood and (related to my work) video games. And as I get older, I find it easier to get through a graphic novel over the weekend then the non-graphic kind.</p>

<p>So <strong>Stan Lee and the Rise and Fall of the American Comic Book</strong> is a timely primer for me on the history of comics in America. The title is a simplification - the U.S. comic book industry went through many business cycles this past century, with Marvel Comics going through a IPO, bankruptcy and resurgence just in the past twenty years. And though the book concentrates on Stan Lee and his role as the face and perhaps soul of Marvel and its creations such as The X-Men and Spiderman, the authors do not spend much time on other companies in the business, e.g. DC Comics (Superman), Japanese manga, and European influences (remember Tin-Tin?).</p>

<p>The focus on Stan Lee and his colleagues at Marvel does provide a vivid sense of the chaotic and prolific &ldquo;early&rdquo; years (which lasted decades), with Lee presiding as editor and writer over artists working long hours for low pay. And this makes it understandable why so much controversy and sometimes personal bitterness erupted over the last few decades about the artists&rsquo; ownership over their work and Stan Lee&rsquo;s plastering of his name over all of Marvel&rsquo;s productions. (&ldquo;Stan Lee presents&hellip;&rdquo;)</p>

<p>The writing is measured and the authors take pains to impart a balanced account, noting that in the old system where work-for-hire was not well defined and comic book artists did not have a high profile like Frank Miller and Tod McFarlane, the artists often failed to share in their creations&rsquo; successes. And while Lee did not actively work against the artists petitions for some ownership of their work (specifically, ownership of the original artwork, which is now an appreciable asset), he implicitly sided with corporate by staying silent during the most public disputes.</p>

<p>But the authors still seem to come off as apologists for Lee, as with other Lee admirers taken in by his convivial nature and willing to attribute embellished accounts of his background (writing prizes that he didn&rsquo;t really win, face-to-face debates with politicians on the morals of comic books that never tok place) to his imagination and hazards of the business. The ability to rationalize self promotion and rewrite history is not much of an excuse, and in my opinion people like that are more dangerous than those who directly take advantage of others. They&rsquo;ll happily climb their way to the top and once there not remember their obligations to others, and that seems to be the case with Stan Lee and his Marvel cohorts. So there is not a little irony in the outcome of Stan Lee&rsquo;s internet venture, which ended during the dot-com bust with an SEC investigation revealing stock-pumping, check-kiting, Lee&rsquo;s partner escaping overseas with ill-gotten gains, and Lee vowing never to trust anyone that much again. Where&rsquo;s a superhero when you need one?</p>
