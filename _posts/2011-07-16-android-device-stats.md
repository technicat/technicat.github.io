Google supplies overall [OS stats](http://developer.android.com/resources/dashboard/platform-versions.html) for the Android Market along with stats for screen sizes and OpenGL versions, but device model stats only show up for your published apps in the developer dashboard. Here’s the latest displayed stats for [HyperBowl](https://market.android.com/details?id=com.technicat.HyperBowl). I wish I knew what’s in that other 63.2%.
