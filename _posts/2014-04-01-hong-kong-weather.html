<p>My first thought upon seeing the HK Weather app was why have a weather app for just once location? But now it&rsquo;s one of my daily-used iPad apps. For one, it looks good and it provides a quick way to check the weather, without even going to the trouble of selecting my location as I would in a regular weather app. But also there is weather data specific to this location, like the color-coded thunderstorm warnings.</p>

<p>Another thing I like is the not-in-your-face placement of the rate-this-app option, right next to the report-a-problem option.</p>

<p>One thing I&rsquo;d like to see in this app is the air quality level, which is also color-coded - if the thundestorm warning is black and the air quality is brown, it&rsquo;s the apocalypse.</p>
