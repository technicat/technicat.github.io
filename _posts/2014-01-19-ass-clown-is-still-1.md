“ass clown” still reigns supreme as the top search term on this blog, but there are some new entries. “mccain mit soda” just looks random. “some people just ignore you image” &nbsp;- what’s that about? My favorites: “weird turtles”, “weird dinosaurs”, and “space cheese.” Give me an astro burger, hold the space cheese.
