<p>It&rsquo;s a new year and time for another web site look. My last makeover of my <a href="http://fugugames.com/">Fugu Games</a> site was implemented in PHP so I could read the tsv files exported by <a href="http://appviz.com/">AppViz</a>. But a colleague recently suggested I look at <a href="http://d3js.org">D3</a>, a Javascript library for data visualization. It reads my tsv files, allows some cool displays like a dynamically sorted bar chart of my App Store sales numbers, and it&rsquo;s all client-side instead of server-side. I&rsquo;m still learning the features - on pie chart coming up!</p>
