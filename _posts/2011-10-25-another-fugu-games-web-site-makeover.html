<p>I had a vision this weekend - it was a vision of my App Store sales displayed in a graph on a web page. So, after some PHP cramming, the <a href="http://fugugames.com/">Fugu Games site</a> now displays my latest app store sales totals (or rather, the latest stats that I manually export from AppViz and upload to my web site).</p>
