I use a lot of Unity middleware, but if I had to pick a favorite, I’d say it’s [iTween](http://itween.pixelplacement.com/). I use it for almost every animation in [HyperBowl](http://hyperbowl3d.com/) (maybe a few dozen scripts, maybe a couple of hundred instances of animated objects throughout the game). And it’s free!

Here’s a quick walk-through on getting iTween into your project. Bring up the Asset Store in Unity

In the Asset Store, search for iTween

Download and import iTween

The new iTween folder will show up at the top level of your Project

I then always move it under Standard Assets/Scripts so that it will be usable by Unityscript/Javascript

The one import file in that folder is the iTween.cs script. Browse through it, read the documentation on the iTween site, consider buying the (really cheap!) example projects, ask questions in the iTween thread on the Unity forum, and don’t forget to write a good review for iTween on the Asset Store!
