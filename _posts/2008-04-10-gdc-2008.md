Yes, the [Game Developer Conference](http://www.gdconf.com/) was over a month ago, but I just started this blog, and it has been six years since my last GDC. So I have to say…the conference is bigger. At least the expo was. Last time I went, everything was in the same exhibit hall - this time, two separate halls with the job booths occupying much of one. I spent the entire afternoon in the main exhibit area, thinking “Oh, I’ll just walk through and then get some lunch”. Five hours later, starving, I thought I’d seen everything of interest but discovered later I’d missed some vendors I’d intended to visit (the [Unity](http://www.unity3d.com/) and GarageGame engines).<!--more-->

Fortunately, as a Unity customer, I managed to meet them (first time face-to-face) at a mixer they were hosting at Kate O'Brien’s. Nice guys, got a good demo from another Unity customer, the occasion was only marred by the dense weekday-evening meat market crowd (two guys at the urinals were discussing how their female companion would “slut up” after drinking - very classy!)

The best part of conferences is meeting old friends and colleagues, and I bumped into a few - Tom Plunket, who was my project lead during a stint at [High Moon Studios](http://www.highmoonstudios.com/), Brendan Kavenaugh, from way back at Nichimen Graphics, and [Aaron Pulkka](http://aaron.pulkka.com/), now at THQ, from my first game job at Hyper Entertainment. I got to see the demos from my current client, [Avatar Reality](http://www.avatar-reality.com/), was introduced to Mr. Shader X himself, Wolfgang Engel, and - bonus! - didn’t see anyone who I wanted to avoid. Not bad for one afternoon!

The only downers: daily rain, an uninteresting IGDA party (or maybe I’m just not an interesting party guy), and a sobering disclosure from my cab driver that he used to be a software developer, before the dot-com bust.
