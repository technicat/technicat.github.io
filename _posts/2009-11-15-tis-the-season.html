<p>With the holiday season nearly upon us, I&rsquo;m busy throwing away the increasing stacks of donation-mail (thank you ACLU, for selling my address!). But I&rsquo;m in the mood to do some revenue-sharing for a good cause, so I&rsquo;m going to try something: through the remainder of this year, 30% of the proceeds for all <a href="http://hyperbowl3d.com/">HyperBowl</a> lanes on the App Store will go to <a href="http://get-well-gamers.org/">Get Well Gamers</a>, a charity based here in Huntington Beach that supplies video games to assist in pain mangament for hospitalized children.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s 30% of what I get from Apple, so for a $.99 app, I get about $.70, and 30% of that is approximately $.21.</p>

<p>There are two HyperBowl lanes right now, <a href="http://itunes.com/app/hyperbowlclassic">HyperBowl Classic</a> and <a href="http://itunes.com/app/hyperbowlrome">HyperBowl Rome</a>, but I might get in one or two more lanes, depending on my own progress, the arrival of the next <a href="http://unity3d.com/">Unity</a> iPhone release, and, as always, Apple approval (in fact, the next Unity iPhone release will address <a href="http://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=26078">new rejection criteria</a> that resultd from the <a href="http://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=25980">Storm8</a> brouhaha)</p>
