In the last few weeks I’ve become more adventurous with WordPress and tried out some plugins. I’ve found these three to be particularly useful:

- [WordBook](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wordbook/) - automatically publishes notifications of new blog posts to your Facebook wall
- [WP\_UnityObject](http://www.thiggins.com/news/?p=112) - allows embedding of Unity web players in blog posts
- [wptouch](http://www.bravenewcode.com/wptouch/) - displays the blog in an iPhone-friendly format when viewed from an iPhone, like this:
