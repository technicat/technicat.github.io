When I first moved to Huntington Beach, it wasn’t hard to find lunch for $5. I can’t even get that at Carl’s Jr. anymore, but there are still some good deals, like this pastrami sandwich and heap of fried zucchini from Harry’s Cafe with a drink, for around $6. More notable - Harry’s is one of the local establishments that serves free meals on Thanksgiving.
