<p>Yesterday, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Garriott">Richard Garriott</a>, aka Lord British, game designer of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultima_(video_game_series)">Ultima</a> series (including <a href="http://www.uoherald.com/news/">Ultima Online</a>) and more recently <a href="http://www.rgtr.com/index.html">Tabula Rasa</a>, <a href="http://www.richardinspace.com/">rode into space</a> aboard a Soyuz launch vehicle. So you aspiring star travellers out there - if NASA rejects your application to join the astronaut corps, you can always fall back to plan B and become a fabulously successful video game designer.</p>
