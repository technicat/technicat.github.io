Despite ranking as my sales leader, I made [Fugu Maze](http://itunes.com/app/fugumaze) free, yesterday.

- Although it’s my top seller, the sales still aren’t that great.
- It started out as a free app last year and did really well (20,000 in the first week)
- I don’t want to deal with the promo codes, anymore (handing them out on toucharcade is like being surrounded by street urchins)
- I want to concentrate on driving revenue to my [HyperBowl](http://itunes.com/app/hyperbowlclassic) apps.
That last tactic is of dubious effectiveness - the problem with free apps is that they attract “customers” who don’t pay for apps (and frankly, you get a better class of review from paying customers). However, dropping the price of an app is one method to gain some visibility (so starting at $1.99 and then dropping to $.99 might be a good strategy). Within a few hours of the price change (which took effect nearly instantly on the App Store), googling revealed several alerts on various sites. I was surprised to see that many don’t just reprint the App Store description - they paraphrase or slightly rewrite it. This one from [poptechnews](http://poptechnews.com/price-drop-fugu-maze-games.html) is bizarre: ![Picture 15](http://itshardtofondlepenguins.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/Picture-15.png "Picture 15")But once you look at the original description, it appears to be a classic case of [machine translation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_translation). ![Picture 18](http://itshardtofondlepenguins.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/Picture-18.png "Picture 18")
