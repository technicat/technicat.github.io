Last it year it was Time-Warner stalking me on the phone with daily telemarketers showing fake interest in my current service as a pretext for pushing more bundles on me. Now it’s Blue Shield - in the past two months, they’ve regularly been leaving robocall messages on my phone saying I need to call them up with a seven digit code (oh, yeah, I memorize them all the time) to hear important benefits information, which turn out to be more recordings which are barely above the level of “don’t get sick”. It makes me almost nostalgic for the Time-Warner calls, who at least were human and had the decency to rudely not leave a message. I don’t like uncivil discourse on the web, but this type of thing brings out the uncivil in me, so I dashed off the following on their web site (under “benefits” - they don’t actually a category for general complaints or inquiries). I normally draw the line at swearing - I reserve that for programming - but I almost crossed it this time.

> Can you stop robocalling messages that just tell me to call for important benefits information with a seven digit code (so that I have to listen to the message multiple times to write it down), only to find another recorded message with tips like don’t go to the emergency room unnecessarily, tips that you could have just mailed me. It is a really obnoxious practice that doesn’t make the health insurance industry look any better, and I wonder what moron thought that was a good idea. That number is my cell phone and registered on the federal do-not-call list, so it should be illegal, too.

Meanwhile, they’ve refrained from increasing premiums yearly due to the threat of action by the state (and this is a non-profit insurer!), and they keep asking me to participate in a survey to help them choose new plan names. Yipee! Fun! Seriously, morons.
