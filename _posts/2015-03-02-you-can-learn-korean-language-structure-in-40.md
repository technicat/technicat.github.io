You Can Learn Korean Language Structure in 40 Minutes](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6235159-yes-you-can-learn-korean-language-structure-in-40-minutes) by [Tong-Ku Lee](https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/2837369.Tong_Ku_Lee)  
My rating: [3 of 5 stars](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1191386258)  
  
I found a bunch of bizarrely chauvenistic aphorisms, while memorable in themselves, really didn’t function well as a mnemonic device for learning Korean. If those were really the basis for Korean writing (while reading this book, I was wondering if the author was pushing a personal philosophy or attempt at humor), I’m disappointed. I initially was so impressed at the design of the Korean writing system that I thought it was worthy of a science fiction writer (Klingon, move over).
