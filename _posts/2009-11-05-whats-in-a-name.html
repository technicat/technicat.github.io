<p>I received a postcard from the city of Huntington Beach saying Sims Street would henceforth be known as Sims Lane, citing database inconsistencies and issues of public safety. When I asked which databases were inconsistent, considering Google, Thomas Bros., and all my bills say Sims Street, they answered with a clarification that Sims St. is inconsistent with a city specification that minor north-south streets would be named &ldquo;Lane&rdquo;. And then there was some more mumbo-jumbo about mismatched databases and public safety. Perhaps there&rsquo;s a real problem to be solved here, but it sounds like someone looked at a map, say the block I live on didn&rsquo;t match the surrounding area with their north-south lanes (and that&rsquo;s a convention?) and decided it just had to be fixed.

This reminds me of one of the more disastrous programming cleanups that I didn&rsquo;t actually instigate, but did accede to. Someone decided one of our functions should have different parameters and consequently changed the function (this is called &ldquo;refactoring&rdquo; nowadays to make it sound like a cool process). This was seamless in that all of the existing uses of the function still compiled, but non-seamless in that they all crashed when run, and it took months to root out each one of them and make the required changes. There is a proper way to do this in software - create a new function (just don&rsquo;t do something lame like just append &ldquo;Ex&rdquo; like Microsoft did in Win32), and deprecate the old one with some kind of compiler warning (new languages support this). Or you can just leave it alone.

In the case of renaming streets, I don&rsquo;t see any seamless transition. Contrary to the purported motivation, renaming the streets is going to result in at least temporary inconsistency in databases (and is Thomas Bros. going to recall all their existing maps from stores?), and I&rsquo;m certain the post office will be receiving mail addressed to both Street and Lane for the next few decades. And that still leaves the question - what about all those streets that run at an angle from North-South? I see some are named &ldquo;Lane&rdquo; and some are named &ldquo;Drive&rdquo;.
