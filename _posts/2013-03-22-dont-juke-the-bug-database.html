<p>Imagine a police department that closes a case if they figure they can&rsquo;t solve it. Say this department tosses away criminal complaints if the suspect is already accused of another crime. And they upgrade misdemeanors to felonies to make sure they get solved.</p>

<p>That would be one messed up police force. It might be entertaining as a TV show (but maybe not - imagine Cold Case if every episode consisted of &ldquo;Wow, this case is really old. Case closed.&rdquo;)</p>

<p>This is often how bug databases are operated, though. Bug reports are closed because they&rsquo;re duplicates, because there&rsquo;s no plan to fix the bug, because the product was released (seriously, I worked on a game project where the publisher marked all bugs as closed when the game shipped), basically because everyone likes seeing bugs closed (except for the bug submitter who didn&rsquo;t get a fix). And I&rsquo;ve seen bugs upgraded from minor to critical to raise their priority as other critical bugs got fixed. This isn&rsquo;t a bug database - it&rsquo;s a to-do list.</p>

<p>A bug database is supposed to represent the truth of the system. It&rsquo;s your weapon against wishful thinking (I presented one of my bosses with the open bug count when he kept trying to cram new features into an impending release - that was enough to get him to back down). It&rsquo;s the history of the product development - each bug is a story that shouldn&rsquo;t end abruptly with &ldquo;and they lived happily ever after. The End.&rdquo; And the bug database is your source of statistics. You should see bug reports spike up and ramp down during a project. But they should be real statistics. To borrow from another TV police drama, The Wire - &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t juke the stats.&rdquo;</p>
