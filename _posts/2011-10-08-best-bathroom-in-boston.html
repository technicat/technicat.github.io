<p><em>Originally written on Epinions in August 2005:</em></p>

<p>I remember my dismay when I arrived as a freshman at MIT - at the overcast sky, the concrete campus, the main street running through that looked like a scene from Deathrace 2000, and the surrounding abandoned warehouses and railroad tracks.</p>

<p>Most ominously, I was warned to be careful at night wandering around dimly-lit Kendall Square, at the east end of campus. But then they started renovating the mass transit (&ldquo;T&rdquo;) station there, putting up new office complexes for the emerging biotech firms, and they dug a big hole that was to be the Cambridge Marriott, anchoring the new Cambridge Center. The rats running through that initial rubble didn&rsquo;t give me a good first impression, but the new hotel turned out to be a godsend.</p>

<p>First of all, as a student and now as a visitor, the Cambridge Marriott provides a convenient and reliable bathroom, just above the main escalators. Finding a restroom when you need one in most big cities is a challenge - I&rsquo;m surprised I haven&rsquo;t seen a &ldquo;Restroom guide to&hellip;&rdquo; series of travel books.</p>

<p>And the Cambridge Marriott was the first hotel on that side of campus. There is a Hyatt on the west end of campus, but that&rsquo;s a long walk (to give you an idea, the main hallway running through the center of campus is called The Infinite Corridor). The Marriott is almost integrated with the T stop - step out into the courtyard facing campus, and you can veer right into a food court or the MIT Coop store which features an intriguing book selection and &ldquo;Someone Loves You at MIT&rdquo; teddy bears. Or step right down into the T stop and take a ten minute ride along the &ldquo;Red Line&rdquo; to Harvard Square or, in the other direction, downtown Boston. And naturally, there are gentlemen hawking various tours standing around. My customary haunts include the MIT Press Bookstore, which features all kinds of texts that you will never see at Barnes and Noble, and Quantum Books, where I load up on computer tomes.</p>

<p>Now there are several newer hotels in Kendall Square - an old firehouse has been converted into &ldquo;The Kendall&rdquo;, and there is a Marriott Residence in on the next block. Perhaps this explains why my room rate this time around was $159, while I remember routinely paying over $200 in previous years. Going up to $199 would have put me in a water-view room (I assume that&rsquo;s the water in the Charles River, separating Cambridge and Boston), but the room I got on the ninth floor had a perfectly decent urban view, plenty of space with immaculate furnishings including a desk, sofa and coffee table, and excellent sound insulation from the outside traffic (and for that matter, from the rest of the hotel). And you cannot understimate the importance of good air conditioning during the humid Boston summers.</p>

<p>The humidity also makes the public washer and dryer useful. There&rsquo;s no charge to use them, but it would have been nice to have more than one. After sweating through a few days worth of clothes, you have to check every half hour to see if the machines are available. As soon as I checked in, I was ready to cool down in the fancy-looking indoor pool in the workout facility - I couldn&rsquo;t remember why I hadn&rsquo;t taken a dip during previous stays, until I discovered the small gift shop didn&rsquo;t have any trunks, despite what the guest guide stated. (So remember to bring some!) For food, the hotel restaurant features expensive &ldquo;American&rdquo; cuisine - I recall they had an excellent brunch years back, but I haven&rsquo;t tried it recently. Starbucks, in their quest for world domination, have a spot in the lobby. If you venture outside for eats, avoid the food court - not much good there despite the throngs of students there during the weekday lunch.</p>

<p>Instead, try Legal&rsquo;s Seafood next door for good (but not cheap) New England seafood. Too bad they no longer have a separate takeout menu - the maitre&rsquo;d (or maybe just a guy at a desk) informed me they revamped the restaurant to match the prices of their meals. Au Bon Pain across the street is a longstanding yuppie soup and sandwich place. And I&rsquo;m happy to say the Chinese food at Mary Chung&rsquo;s in Central Square, one T stop away or a brief walk, is as delicious as ever - the service has been on and off over the years, but famous smart people have always loved the food.</p>

<p>And you can add the Cambridge Marriott to that list of reliables. I&rsquo;ll continue to try out various Boston area hotels, but I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;ll come back to the Cambridge Marriott - they always seem to have a good room available and professional courteous service when I&rsquo;m in the neighborhood.</p>
