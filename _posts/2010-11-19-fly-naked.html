<p>After I made my Thanksgiving travel plans, I made the mistake of checking my twitter feed and reading all the TSA stories that are showing up, so now I have some buyers remorse. But I&rsquo;ve got to fly sometime. Or get a new car and lots of gas money.</p>

<p>The way I see it, there are really two fundamental issues here. One is, how far are you willing to go? Someone tries to blow up his shoe, so now we have to take off our shoes. No big deal. A plot to use liquid explosives was discovered, so now we have to throw out our drinks and buy new ones at the airport concession. Movie theaters do the same thing. So now someone tries to ignite his underwear, and consequently we have to choose between a porno-scan and groin check (or boob-fondling for the ladies). There has to be a line somewhere, and if we haven&rsquo;t crossed it yet, we&rsquo;re getting close. So if this turns out to be insufficient, what&rsquo;s next? Strip searches? Cavity searches? Regardless of your opinion on the necessity of these measures, logically, that&rsquo;s where it would go. Think of your flight as a short prison term (if you&rsquo;ve been stranded on a tarmac, you must have made the analogy already).<br/>
And frankly, just getting naked (and perhaps bending over) would avoid the pat-downs and save the expense of buying all those machines.</p>

<p>That reminds me of the Robert Heinlein novel The Puppet Masters, where an invasion of aliens that attached themselves to humans and commandeered their bodies were held in check by a public nudity requirement, enforced by checkpoints. (I don&rsquo;t think that part made it into the movie) In the book, the necessity of these measures were unquestioned, but also so were the authority and competence of those in charge.</p>

<p>This I think is the second basic issue - the TSA is saying &ldquo;Even if you don&rsquo;t like it, even if it doesn&rsquo;t make sense to you, trust us, we know what we&rsquo;re doing.&rdquo; I have some problems with that:</p>

<p>Human nature. If your job all day is to look at naked pics or fondle people, aren&rsquo;t you going to try to get the good-looking ones? I would. I have to admit, when I heard the PA system at John Wayne Airport blaring that a female screener was required, I tried to get a look at the soon-to-be-frisked and see how hot she was. Poor gal was standing there like Steve Martin in The Lonely Guy when it was loudly announced he wanted a table for one.</p>

<p>All the stories I&rsquo;ve seen/read/heard about said human behavior in action, profiling for hotties, retaliating against those who balk, the bureaucrat-speak (&ldquo;groin check&rdquo; - really?)</p>

<p>Personal experience. I&rsquo;ve met some courteous and professional TSA agents. Unfortunately, that&rsquo;s probably less than half. For example, at JFK, the Jetblue agents there always make that mysterious mark on my ticket that indicates I&rsquo;m to be patted down. Now, I think if I&rsquo;m cooperative and friendly (no hard feelings), I should expect the same, instead of a terse &ldquo;keep moving&rdquo;. (if a groin-check is involved, I think someone owes me dinner. I&rsquo;ll have the lobster) Fortunately, I discovered I could avoid the pat-down just by checking in at the automated kiosk (does that make sense?)</p>

<p>LAX is worse. I ended up with a bonus pat-down because I made the mistake of standing next to a TSA agent who was busy yelling randomly at people then turned to me and couldn&rsquo;t remember if I was one of those she directed to the pat-down line. They similarly misplaced my bag after I sat down to tie my shoes and forgot about it. When I returned to ask if I&rsquo;d left a bag there, the airport police officer directed me to a TSA agent who just said &ldquo;no.&rdquo; I gave up on it, until the police officer tracked me down at my departure gate and said my bag was actually sitting there behind the uninformative agent. Score one for the airport police (he was even willing to call in the LAPD to look for it!) As for the TSA, you&rsquo;d think they would show some interest in an unattended bag. Haven&rsquo;t they heard all those airport intercom announcements?</p>

<p>I prefer going to smaller airports now. The TSA people at Long Beach and Bend are pretty cool, and I never feel like I got targeted for some reason, although I was dismayed when an agent at Long Beach noticed I was carrying a history book on ancient China called A Case of Treason and said I couldn&rsquo;t bring it aboard (she let me off with a warning, but really, it&rsquo;s not like the title was Bomb-making for Dummies)</p>

<p>Will Rogers Airport in Oklahoma surprised me - they were less friendly than I expected, and, adding insult to injury, I got designated for a pat-down after getting bumped from a flight and directed to go back out to get a new ticket. Although, the carry-on baggage screener did notice I had some a statuette from the Cowboy Museum (those x-ray machines work!) and handed it to me so it wouldn&rsquo;t get mushed against the other packages. Still better than LAX.</p>

<p>These may seem like a few isolated instances, but I only fly a couple of times a year. So each time I hope for the best and expect the worse (to be fair, that&rsquo;s my expectation of air travel in general). To sum it up, I trust my doctor to grope me and view my naked body, but not the guy who just lost my luggage.</p>
