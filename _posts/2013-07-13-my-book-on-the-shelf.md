At last, [my book](http://learnunity4.com/) is on the store shelves (this is an advantage of going with Apress as a publisher - they have a strong retail presence). At my local Barnes and Noble, I found it nestled against Visual Basic Programming for Teens.

This might seem surprising, but if you’re not self-publishing, it’s actually easier to track print sales than ebook sales. Amazon’s Author Central displays BookScan numbers, which aggregate print book sales from various retailers, including Barnes and Noble and Amazon.com (too bad Borders is no longer around - would have loved to see my book there). The stats are incomplete, since not all retailers participate, but still, it’s better than nothing.
