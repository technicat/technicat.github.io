I generally don’t like to see ads in apps (or anywhere else for that matter), but in a few cases it’s not too distracting, e.g. the NY Times app on the iPad. And since Apple incorporated iAds into its one-stop publishing framework, I figured I’d give the iAds plugin from [Prime 31 Studios](http://prime31.com/) a try (testing not just iAds and the plugin, but also the combination with [Unity 3.0](http://unity3d.com/) and the HD resolutions on the 4th-gen iPhone and iPod touch). I decided it might look OK on [Fugu Bowl](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/fugubowl/id297032758?mt=8), since there’s plenty of space on the bottom and top, and it’s a free app (actually, my most downloaded app)

I was a bit worried, since during testing I didn’t see any test ads, and the review period was long - maybe because I hadn’t specified any exclusion keywords in the ad settings, and the system didn’t seem to think I’d finished setting it up. Anyway, after excluding “weapons” (the example used by Apple in its docs), the app was approved,&nbsp; yesterday, and the ad display works. (I never thought I’d be relieved to see ads appear in an app!) It doesn’t show ads all the time, which I think is nice. You decide.
