<p>The first nickel of revenue from my first integration of <a href="http://kiip.me/">Kiip Rewards</a> (on <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/app/fugu-maze/id295808255">Fugu Maze</a>) has rolled in, so I&rsquo;m trying it out on some more apps, and of course, now I have to relearn the integration steps.</p>

<p>Overall, it&rsquo;s pretty simple. Just go to github, search for &ldquo;kiip&rdquo; and you&rsquo;ll find their Unity SDK, with the integration steps listed in their readme file. The core Kiip library itself is presented as a download after you create a Kiip developer account, add your app (if it&rsquo;s a published app, the dashboard conveniently fills in the app information when you type in the name), and start the walkthrough.</p>

<p>As is often the case, the most tedious portion of the integration is in XCode. After you perform the Unity build, you need to add the Kiip library to your project:</p>

<p>And then add the MobileCoreServices framework and libxml dylib (bottom of the Build Phases tab)</p>

<p>One final thing that might trip you up - in the dashboard you have to complete the walkthrough by click on the Submit button for Kiip to be activated with your app.</p>
