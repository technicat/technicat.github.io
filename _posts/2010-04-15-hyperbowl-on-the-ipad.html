<p>I got a nice birthday present this week - the latest version of <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/hyperbowl/id344209253?mt=8">HyperBowl, with native support for the iPad</a>, was approved and showed up on the App Store. It took two submissions, the first one rejected because I didn&rsquo;t support both portrait and portrait upside-down orientations, but overall it still just took a few days to get through. Development-wise, it took a couple of days to get it running on the iPad while verifying that it still ran on the iPhone (since this is a &ldquo;universal&rdquo; build instead of a separate iPad-only app).</p>

<p>The iPad version is a bit faster than the iPhone, although I had to make some tweaks to avoid some performance killers, in particular removing fog from the Forest lane. I&rsquo;m sad to see it go, but the original HyperBowl didn&rsquo;t have fog, either, and and the increased resolution is a good tradeoff. At 768x1024, this might be the highest-resolution HyperBowl yet! (the original PC game was running in a 448x588 section of a 1024x768 screen). I was tempted to follow the current trend and name it HyperBowl HD! But I didn&rsquo;t.</p>

<p>As with the previous iPhone release, this version supports the Scoreloop social gaming network. I search for &ldquo;Scoreloop&rdquo; on my iPad App Store, HyperBowl is the only iPad game that shows up. I&rsquo;m pretty sure it&rsquo;s not really the only one, or the first, but I&rsquo;m not complaining.</p>
