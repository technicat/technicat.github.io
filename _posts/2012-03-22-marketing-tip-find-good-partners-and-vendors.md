Yesterday I filled out a developer interview form for AppCraver, and one question asked about marketing tips. Much of what I’ve done is what everyone else tells you to do (use social media, yada yada…), but one thing I’ve never heard anyone say is to work with good partners and vendors.

For example, I make extensive use of the Prime31 plugins for iOS and Android, but it’s a nice touch that he has a gallery showing his customers’ works. That’s mutually beneficial. With Apple, I wonder who you have to sleep with to get Featured or even listed as New and Noteworthy, and Amazon gives me the same attitude but with less revenue and editorial control, while in contrast, Unity kindly mentioned HyperBowl in one of their monthly newsletters and Barnes and Noble listed HyperBowl in a press release. Plus they’ve all been helpful and responsive on a developer level, which has also been a promising attribute with my recent interactions with Kiip and Ubinuri.

Now, I don’t really know if all that promotional help has made a difference in sales, but I like working with good people - working by yourself as an independent developer you can still feel like part of a team. And it works both ways. If you want people to help you out, you should give the same help, at least to those you feel deserve it. The people at Zeemote have been great in supplying free Android joysticks for a HyperBowl promotion, and I hope their product really takes off. So besides the promotion, I retweet their tweets and they’ve retweeted me. I retweet important updates about the prime31 plugins, hit the tweet button the Unity Asset Store pages that I like, relay important Unity news, exchange tips with other developers.

I don’t respond to sites that want money to write or “expedite” a review, but I do buy ads on sites that give me decent reviews or run good promotions, and they don’t have to be 5-star reviews, just honest reviews that aren’t jackassy. For example, after I got a well-written 3-star review on SlapApp, I took out an ad for several months and paid them to make a HyperBowl video. So that’s my other marketing tip. Don’t blow your cash on the more parasitical elements of the app ecosystem, spend it on the more deserving players. I can’t promise it’s best for business, but it’s good for the soul.
