I’m amazed that during talk of mortgage relief and the housing meltdown, scurrilous mortgage lenders are still operating.<!--more-->

The most recent one I received had urgency written all over the envelope

and a generic company name that sounds like it might be affiliated with my original lender

promises of lowering my payments

and even cash back!

and finally, the fine print at bottom indicating that this is an interest-only loan, and they’re not really affiliated with the original mortgate lender

This is actually one of the less blatantly misleading solicitations I’ve seen. Most have my original lender’s name plastered on the envelope and letter, and one had the word “Federal” in its company name along with a logo that resembled that of a government agency, and fine print stating it wasn’t a federal agency. If anyone deserves to get kicked out of their homes, it’s these guys.
