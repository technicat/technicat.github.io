My rating: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1048571451">3 of 5 stars</a><br/><br/>
This book brings up many interesting issues like avatar rights, how or whether to report possible real-world crimes that a related in the virtual world, corporate undergovernance and overgovernance, online misbehavior, underage users operating virtual prostitutes&hellip;but it&rsquo;s obscured by the usual fascination with cybersex (teledildonics, anyone?), the grudge-like complaining over how the author was treated by EA (it sounds like me complaining about my cable provider) and the distracting use of third-person in a first-person narrative. Imagine listening to a sports star talk to about himself in the third person at book length.
