<p>﻿﻿﻿I decided my <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/fugugames">YouTube</a> channel looked silly with just one video, so I scoured my hard drive for more videos and found just two more.</p>

<p>This one is a montage of the modelling demos built into <a href="http://www.izware.com/">Nendo 1.5</a>, which I helped release a few years ago. I guess I put this together with the idea of having a &ldquo;demo reel&rdquo;, and also learning <a href="http://www.apple.com/ilife/imovie/">iMovie</a> and trying out the video capture program <a href="http://www.ambrosiasw.com/utilities/snapzprox/">SnapZ ProX</a>.</p>



<p>And this is your typical cat-at-play video, one of the few times I&rsquo;ve used the video feature on my Canon Powershot:</p>
