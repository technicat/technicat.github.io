<p>After reading on the web that Kanye West only communicates via email, no skype or phone, I&rsquo;ll say something that I don&rsquo;t say often - I&rsquo;m with Kanye on this one. I only have skype (which I think of as &ldquo;skypus interruptus&rdquo;) on when I&rsquo;m working for someone who insists on it, and then I&rsquo;m rewarded with a stream of is-it-done-yet&rsquo;s, which makes it remarkably difficult to actually get anything done, not to mention jokes, salutations, and random questions from coworkers. There should be a rule - if you have something worth interrupting someone&rsquo;s work, you should have to walk over and talk face-to-face. And this just might help combat America&rsquo;s obesity epidemic.</p>

<p>But realtime chat is still better than phone meetings. In general, I feel like people who only want to discuss business over the phone are determined to waste my time, in particular, third-party recruiters (not first-party recruiters - if they want to talk, there&rsquo;s actually something to talk about, like, a job), and people in the ad business. Recent emails I&rsquo;ve received from ad people are filled with phrases like &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s talk!&rdquo;, &ldquo;Action Required&rdquo;, and &ldquo;Meeting Request&rdquo;, instead of giving me useful information.</p>

<p>I always thought pr/marketing/ad people had a screwy way of doing things, almost as if they&rsquo;re taught, take everything you&rsquo;re supposed to do for a smoothly running engineering project, and do the opposite (or perhaps just watch The Apprentice and do what they do). I&rsquo;ve sat in cubicles listening to nearby PR or account managers spend easily an hour at a time just shooting the breeze with their counterpart at the other end until finally getting to the reason for the call.</p>

<p>This is amusing (unless you&rsquo;re sitting nearby trying to think), until it turns into unnecessary crunch time work for you. At my first stint in a commercial software company, I saw our marketing department tell our artists they needed ad material in a few hours, after casually discussing it with the targeted magazine for months. I&rsquo;ve been on the receiving end, too, pestered by our marketing director to crank out a demo build in a few hours, only to find out secondhand months later that it was never used.</p>

<p>Which reminds me, although engineers get knocked on their people skills, people in the people business don&rsquo;t seem any better. I&rsquo;ve had some ad agencies inquire about my services in the past year. None of them made any mention of payment or inquired about my rate, one of them gave me a nice reply when I said I wasn&rsquo;t available at that time, another didn&rsquo;t bother to reply at all when I mentioned my rate, and another wanted me to sign an NDA and then look over their code before discussing even the nature of the business arrangement. I love watching Mad Men, and Don Draper is a cool cat, but I wouldn&rsquo;t want to work for him.</p>
