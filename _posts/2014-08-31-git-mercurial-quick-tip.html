I use github for my public projects and for my private projects on bitbucket, I could use git, but just for the sake of trying something different, at the risk of making things more difficult for myself, I use mercurial. Actually, since I use the Sourcetree GUI for bitbucket, it hasn&rsquo;t really mattered so far, except the default syntax for ignore files is different. But here&rsquo;s a quick tip: just add &ldquo;syntax: glob&rdquo; to the .gitignore file (and rename it to .hgignore), and you&rsquo;re fine.

For example here&rsquo;s the line added to the .gitignore taken from one of the Xamarin repos on github to make it usable with mercurial:

<pre>
syntax: glob
*.pidb
*.userprefs
*.swp
*.DS_Store
*.nib

obj/*
bin/*
*/bin/*
*/obj/*
*/*/bin/*
*/*/obj/*
</pre>
