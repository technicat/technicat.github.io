<p>Over a recent dinner with friends I observed that some films could have been made by anyone but more often you can tell the filmmaker (or conglomeration of directors-writers-producers) is white. They resemble the usual pop-fiction novels where apparently the characters are by default white because the race of every non-white character is loudly announced (typically there&rsquo;s a tough African-American who jokes about being the only African-American).</p>

<p>Unfortunately some of my favorite films and TV shows suffer from WWS (White Writer&rsquo;s Syndrome). Looking at Buffy the Vampire Slayer&rsquo;s town of Sunnydale you might think California has no Latinos or Asians (but they do have lots of vampires). Veronica Mars&rsquo; town of Neptune did have plenty of Latinos - in a gang. Both shows looked like they made a self-conscious effort to diversify a little in ensuing seasons, but I still can&rsquo;t get over Joss Whedon&rsquo;s vision of the future in Firefly, in which the cosmos was split among the remnants of the Chinese and American empires and all the characters you see curse cheerfully in Chinese, and there&rsquo;s nary an Asian face in sight. It&rsquo;s the isn&rsquo;t-Asian-culture-cool esthetic evident in Blade Runner - future LA is suffused with Asian culture in the form of video geisha billboards and Chinese vendors and cyclists in coolie hats, but the main players are Caucasians who look they like fell out of a noir movie.</p>

<p>Of course, if you want to see an LA with Asian influence, you could just look around now. There&rsquo;s Thai Town, Chinatown, Little Tokyo, Monterey Park, and Asian-Americans like me who live in the burbs, speak English and the most foreign clothing I wear are Hawaiian shirts. This reminds me of my reaction when I watched Dark Angel. It was a bit more diverse than your average show, but with one sassy black character and one Jamaican black character and hardly an Asian in all of Seattle (except Chinatown, of course), I wasn&rsquo;t surprised when I heard on the DVD commentary that this diversity (including the multi-racial Jessica Alba) was the show creators&rsquo; vision of an ethnically diverse future Seattle. I&rsquo;m going to hazard a guess that you could look around Seattle now and get a better picture.</p>

<p>So far I&rsquo;ve just been carping about old news, and I could bore the heck out of you (perhaps it&rsquo;s too late) picking at every show that peeves me and praising the few that don&rsquo;t (BSG, Eureka). But I find it interesting that animated casts, including the newer CG characters, aren&rsquo;t faring better (with the exception of a few Disney films). Now, you can&rsquo;t say you drew or modelled a virtual white character because no minorities applied. (at least virtual character don&rsquo;t have to worry about the casting couch!) Recently, I finally got around to playing the first Drake&rsquo;s Fortune game on my PS3. A good game with Indiana Jones type of story, featuring an all-white cast of protagonists ( a scoundrelly Latin-American nemesis). But if you view the behind-the-scene extras, you&rsquo;ll see the development staff at Naughty Dog is a diverse bunch, more than you&rsquo;ll likely see in any game or movie. Sometimes, it&rsquo;d be nice if fantasy was more like real life.</p>
