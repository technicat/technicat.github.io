One convenient thing about tumblr is they make it easy to customize the domain for your blog, which perhaps is a reason why so many sites use tumblr for their blog page (I’m thinking of sketchfab.com and itch.io, for example). The tumblr help doc isn’t quite complete,&nbsp;

but as another testament to the popularity of this option, it seems every ISP tells you how to do it, for example GoDaddy:

and Google Domains:

compare this to Medium, which seems more grudging about it:
