<p>Yes, the <a href="http://www.gdconf.com/">Game Developer Conference</a> was over a month ago, but I just started this blog, and it has been six years since my last GDC. So I have to say&hellip;the conference is bigger. At least the expo was. Last time I went, everything was in the same exhibit hall - this time, two separate halls with the job booths occupying much of one. I spent the entire afternoon in the main exhibit area, thinking &ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;ll just walk through and then get some lunch&rdquo;. Five hours later, starving, I thought I&rsquo;d seen everything of interest but discovered later I&rsquo;d missed some vendors I&rsquo;d intended to visit (the <a href="http://www.unity3d.com/">Unity</a> and GarageGame engines).<!--more--></p>

<p>Fortunately, as a Unity customer, I managed to meet them (first time face-to-face) at a mixer they were hosting at Kate O'Brien&rsquo;s. Nice guys, got a good demo from another Unity customer, the occasion was only marred by the dense weekday-evening meat market crowd (two guys at the urinals were discussing how their female companion would &ldquo;slut up&rdquo; after drinking - very classy!)</p>

<p>The best part of conferences is meeting old friends and colleagues, and I bumped into a few - Tom Plunket, who was my project lead during a stint at <a href="http://www.highmoonstudios.com/">High Moon Studios</a>, Brendan Kavenaugh, from way back at Nichimen Graphics, and <a href="http://aaron.pulkka.com/">Aaron Pulkka</a>, now at THQ, from my first game job at Hyper Entertainment. I got to see the demos from my current client, <a href="http://www.avatar-reality.com/">Avatar Reality</a>, was introduced to Mr. Shader X himself, Wolfgang Engel, and - bonus! - didn&rsquo;t see anyone who I wanted to avoid. Not bad for one afternoon!</p>

<p>The only downers: daily rain, an uninteresting IGDA party (or maybe I&rsquo;m just not an interesting party guy), and a sobering disclosure from my cab driver that he used to be a software developer, before the dot-com bust.</p>
