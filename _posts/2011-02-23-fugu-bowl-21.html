<p>After nine days, <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/fugubowl/id297032758?mt=8">Fugu Bowl 2.1</a> was approved on the App Store yesterday. Originally, this app was an experimental testbed for <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/hyperbowl/id344209253?mt=8">HyperBowl</a> controls, but it&rsquo;s continued in a guinea pig role. I think it&rsquo;s the first app I made universal, when the iPad came out, and the in the last release I tried out iAds, using the plugin from <a href="http://prime31.com/">Prime31 Studios</a>. This latest update tried out <a href="http://unity3d.com/">Unity 3.2</a>, two more Prime31 plugins (the Etcetera plugin for the Rate feature, and the Game Center plugin), and GUIKit001 from <a href="http://gameassets.net/">GameAssets.net</a> for the pause menu.</p>

<p>Interestingly, Fugu Bowl is also my best &ldquo;selling&rdquo; app, with 75,000 non-upgrade downloads. I only just noticed on <a href="http://appannie.com/">App Annie</a> that the app has been included in &ldquo;What&rsquo;s Hot&rdquo; in several non-US app stores. Maybe simple apps without a lot of non-localized text do better worldwide? (the far more complex HyperBowl app has most of its sales in the US and British commonwealth)</p>
