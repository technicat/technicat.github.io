With the holiday season nearly upon us, I’m busy throwing away the increasing stacks of donation-mail (thank you ACLU, for selling my address!). But I’m in the mood to do some revenue-sharing for a good cause, so I’m going to try something: through the remainder of this year, 30% of the proceeds for all [HyperBowl](http://hyperbowl3d.com/) lanes on the App Store will go to [Get Well Gamers](http://get-well-gamers.org/), a charity based here in Huntington Beach that supplies video games to assist in pain mangament for hospitalized children.

That’s 30% of what I get from Apple, so for a $.99 app, I get about $.70, and 30% of that is approximately $.21.

There are two HyperBowl lanes right now, [HyperBowl Classic](http://itunes.com/app/hyperbowlclassic) and [HyperBowl Rome](http://itunes.com/app/hyperbowlrome), but I might get in one or two more lanes, depending on my own progress, the arrival of the next [Unity](http://unity3d.com/) iPhone release, and, as always, Apple approval (in fact, the next Unity iPhone release will address [new rejection criteria](http://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=26078) that resultd from the [Storm8](http://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=25980) brouhaha)
