Recently I’ve been asked in various forms how does one get into programming, and it’s an interesting question. Especially with the proliferation of free game engines, there are a lot of non-programmers trying to program, or at least cobbling enough together to get a game going. Even though there’s a broad spectrum of good and bad programmers and everything in between, it seems to me there’s still a clear distinction between programmers and non-programmers (perhaps you could say this of artists, too).

I’m tempted to say that real programmers know how to look stuff up on their own, and I think that is true, but clearly there are a lot of programmers who find it more convenient to take up someone else’s time. Certainly, I have been guilty of that, and I’ve had coworkers who would ask me all kinds of questions instead of checking the documentation themselves (I even had one colleague ask me to explain OpenGL to him - I just handed him the book).

I think the real difference between programmers and non-programmers is the ability to break down a problem. For example, on the Unity forums, I often see the question “how do I make a pause button?"&nbsp; or "how do I make a pause menu?” That is actually two different questions, how to pause a game and how to make a button or menu (you can tell just by seeing the two different questions and factoring out the common component, how do I pause? Kind of mathy, isn’t it?) Even asking “how do I pause a game” is somewhat general - think about what exactly you want to pause. If you realize that you want to pause animations, physics and any code that depends on the simulated game time, you might realize that what you really want is to halt the game time. And then you can exercise that second programming skill, reading up on game time and GUI’s in the documentation (the third skill is using the search box effectively - it amazes me in this age of Google people can’t search!)

I guess it’s really an issue of knowing how to approach a problem. Engineers and scientists don’t always make the best programmers, but they can usually pick up coding fairly easily. But if you treat programming like magic, (can someone give me a spell for this?), you’re not going to get far. The first step is describing your problem usefully - don’t be the “I need help coding!” guy (check out the negatively-voted question on Unity Answers below)
