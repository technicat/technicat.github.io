I have a couple of ideas how I’d like my personal site to look. One is a war-room style display that shows feeds from all my other sites. The other is some kind of web graph that shows how all my sites and various accounts and mentions are all connected. In the meantime, I’ve just been using iWeb, partly just so I know how to use iWeb, but the problem is, it looks like it was made using iWeb.

So after browsing onto someone’s [about.me](http://about.me/) page, I saw it basically supplies what I’ve been doing with iWeb, mostly just linking to my other sites, but prettier. And I noticed one of about.me’s founders is an old coworker of mine, so I gave it a try, and I’m impressed - it’s the smoothest browser-based page editing I’ve seen. All changes take place as you make them, no need to hit a Save button. Of course, that means no revert, but there isn’t really a need for that, since the editing options are so simple and well designed. For example, when you upload a background image, it goes in a palette, so if you try another image, you can switch back with one click.

The options are limited - pick a background image, pick a profile image, write bio text, select from a set of social networking and blogging sites, add to a list of URL’s, and that’s it. But maybe that’s a good thing. I’ve redirected [my personal site URL](http://philipchu.com/) to about.me so I gave up my cat/family/local photos, but that’s what photo web sites are for (about.me supports feeds from instagram and flickr).

There are some other features. I like the randomly-display-a-someone’s-page button, good for getting ideas on page design. The stats page shows your Klout score (I assume you have to register with Klout, which I already did). It seems to me my Klout influence is really my twitter influence and doesn’t take in account, for example, people reading my [Technicat web site](http://technicat.com/)or reading [my blog](http://fugutalk.com/) or playing [my games](http://fugugames.com/). But in the past month I’ve been upgraded from average to “networker”. Flattery will get you everywhere!
