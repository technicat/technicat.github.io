<p>I&rsquo;ve seen a couple of recent complaints that the black-and-white <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/hyperbowl/id344209253">HyperBowl</a> icon is too bland. I thought the toucharcade forum member was overly dramatic (&ldquo;get rid of that hideous monstrosity&rdquo;) and I&rsquo;m skeptical that it was the only thing preventing his purchase. But I though the HowsMyApp review had a good point that there should be differentiation between the full HyperBowl game and the individual lanes also on the App Store. So I dug this new one out of the archives, which has some color.</p>
