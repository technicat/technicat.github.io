Despite its pitch as “Gray’s Anatomy in Space”, I started watching episodes of Defying Gravity on the PlayStation Store. (I was looking for Dollhouse, but oddly, that’s listed under Crime instead of Sci-Fi). Defying Gravity is not bad - I like the characters and story arc, could do without the cutesy music, yes, reminiscent of Gray’s Anatomy. But it’s no Firefly. So it’s fitting that when I searched for “defying gravity” on YouTube, I found this homage to Firefly.
