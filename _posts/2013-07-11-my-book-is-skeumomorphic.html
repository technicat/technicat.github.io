<p>For some reason, I didn&rsquo;t think <a href="http://learnunity4.com/">my book</a> would show up on the iBookstore, maybe because I just didn&rsquo;t remember seeing other Apress titles there, although they seem to do a better job on ebooks (kindle and nook) than some other publishers (scanned pages - yuck!).</p>

<p>And I did check the iBookstore when I saw the kindle and nook version were available, and my book wasn&rsquo;t there. But more recently, I verified the Apress ebooks were finalized (I received regular email notices of new downloads during the alpha period, but not for the final), and tried out the epub version (during alpha, only the PDF was available), and on my iPad it looked just like an iBook.</p>

<p>So I went back to the iBookstore, and there it was!</p>

<p>To tell you the truth, iBooks are not my favorite reading media - they look great for demos, but I find the nook and kindle easier to read. The iBook looks pretty and well-formatted, though, and as far as I can tell, all the links work fine. Maybe I can attribute this to the iBook&rsquo;s straightforward use of epub (who knows what&rsquo;s going on with the nook and kindle - they both take Word format, among others, but that&rsquo;s never a good sign. The nook actually does a pretty good job with epub, but the kindle drops the TOC).</p>

<p>Anyway, I downloaded the sample from the iBookstore to make sure it looked the same. I&rsquo;m assuming that it&rsquo;s a (cute) feature that the sample cover is shorter.</p>
