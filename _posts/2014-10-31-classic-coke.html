<p>Just around the corner from my place is Planet Mix, a suitably named hodgepodge of CDs, video, comic books and video games. My favorite item is their Coke machine, dispensing since 1954. Although it still takes a dime for each Coke, the store actually charges a dollar (you hand over the dollar at the counter and they give you a dime for the machine). That&rsquo;s still a good deal.</p>
