The sofa used to be my sanctuary from the Internet, but by now I’ve found some free iPhone apps that serve my obssessive-compulsive need to monitor my email, facebook wall, and news feeds.

Using Free RSS, I can monitor newsgroups, in particular the Unity forum.

Tweetdeck is actually better than the Twitter desktop web page. The first time I brought it up, Tweetdeck showed me all the twitter replies I’ve missed.

And then there’s Facebook. The first time I tried the Facebook iPhone app, I wasn’t impressed, but I think they revamped it, because it’s got a pretty good interface now, including an easy way to add fan pages as Favorites (short cuts). I don’t see any easy way to access group pages, though.
