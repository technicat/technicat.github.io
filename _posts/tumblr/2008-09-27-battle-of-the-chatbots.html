<p>One of my less-smart career decisions was in joining a startup in Venice, CA that aimed to deploy talking 3D characters to field customer support requests. Attempting to beat the Turing Test is a lofty challenge, but after all, I did leave the Bay Area, filled with MBA&rsquo;s starting B2B ventures, to find something interesting. My mistake was selecting a technology company run by Hollywood producers (didn&rsquo;t work for Yahoo, either) and not testing the demo myself - the snarky animated figure couldn&rsquo;t even respond to &ldquo;Hello&rdquo;. (You lost me at hello)</p>

<p>Still, just for fun, I&rsquo;ve been meaning to implement yet another front end to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELIZA">Eliza</a>, but then I read about the more modern <a href="http://alicebot.blogspot.com/">AliceBot</a> in Bruce Wilcox&rsquo;s gamasutra article <a href="http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/3761/beyond_aiml_chatbots_102.php">Beyond AIML: Chatbots 102.</a></p>

<p>So I decided to have them talk to each other, using web-based<br/><a href="http://www-ai.ijs.si/eliza-cgi-bin/eliza_script">Eliza</a> and <a href="http://alicebot.blogspot.com/">AliceBot</a> implementations. The conversation bogs down quickly:</p>

<p>Human: How can I help you?<br/>
ALICE: Just keep talking to me as long as you can.<br/>
Human: Do you wish to as long as me?<br/>
ALICE: OK, I will as long as you.<br/>
Human: Do you wish to will as long as me?<br/>
ALICE: OK, I will will as long as you.<br/>
Human: Do you wish to will will as long as me?<br/>
ALICE: OK, I will will will as long as you.</p>
