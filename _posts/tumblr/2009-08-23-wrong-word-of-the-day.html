<p>I&rsquo;m used to seeing big words misused on ESPN, but on C-SPAN last week I saw one member of the Center for Immigration Studies (apparently better named as the Center for Anti-Immigration Studies, and the use of &ldquo;Studies&rdquo; is questionable, too), while commenting on the uneducated nature of Mexican immigrants, use the word &ldquo;misnomer&rdquo; in place of &ldquo;misconception&rdquo;. (I wonder if I should create a new blog category titled &ldquo;Irony&rdquo;)</p>

<p>A misnomer is a misapplied term. For example,</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a misconception to think that &ldquo;misnomer&rdquo; has the same meaning as &ldquo;misconception&rdquo;.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Misnomer&quot;Â  is a misnomer when used to indicate a misconception.</p>
