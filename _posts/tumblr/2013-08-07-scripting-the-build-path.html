Here&rsquo;s an extra function I added to Unity Editor script for my <a href="http://hyperbowl3d.com/">HyperBowl</a> configuration menu to make sure I build to the same filename each time, located under the project folder next to Assets. Sometimes that&rsquo;s not important, but sometimes it is, like when I&rsquo;m updating a webplayer or executable that I&rsquo;m referencing by filename. Besides, it saves a little bit of typing at build time!
<pre>static void SetBuildPath(BuildTarget target, string name) {
				string path = Application.dataPath;
				path = path.Substring(0, path.LastIndexOf("Assets"));
				EditorUserBuildSettings.SetBuildLocation(target,path+"/"+name);
		}</pre>
and then I call it like this:
<pre>[MenuItem ("FuguGames/HyperBowl/iOS/HyperBowl Classic")]
static void Classic() {
	PlayerSettings.productName = "HyperBowl Classic";
	PlayerSettings.bundleIdentifier = "com.technicat.HyperBowlClassic";
	PlayerSettings.use32BitDisplayBuffer = true;
	PlayerSettings.SetScriptingDefineSymbolsForGroup(BuildTargetGroup.iPhone,"HYPERCLASSIC;"+freeDefs);
	iOSIcon ("classic512.png");
	SetBuildPath(BuildTarget.iPhone,"iOSClassic");
	TargetiOS();
}</pre>
