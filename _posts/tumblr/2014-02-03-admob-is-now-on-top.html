<p>I just linked my AdMob account to App Annie and was instantly rewarded with a new insight: my AdMob revenue now exceeds my iAd revenue. Or in other words, Android ads are making me more money than iOS ads.</p>

<p>This is a recent trend. For a long time, my iAd revenue has dominated. And I&rsquo;m still way down from that spike a couple of years ago.</p>

<p>My App Store earnings are still higher when you include sales figures, but overall, the gap is closing (and my Amazon sales have improved lately, so if you include that&hellip;). Apple, you&rsquo;re still my most important platform. But just barely.</p>
