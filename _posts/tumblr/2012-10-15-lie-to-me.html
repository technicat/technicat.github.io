<p>Coffee Prince is still my favorite Korean drama, but Lie to Me (starring the same actress, who strikes me as sort of a Korean version of Sandra Bullock, or Sandra Bullock is an American version of her). I&rsquo;m not normally a sucker for romances, but throw in great acting and chemistry, humor, and scenes with good-looking food&hellip;</p>
