<p><em>Originally written on Epinions in September 2007:</em></p>

<p>Years ago, when I was anxious to throw my money down the dot-com toilet like everyone else, I tried to join ETrade a couple of times, but got found the new-member signup too tedious. Instead, I made my bad investment decisions with DLJDirect, which later became HarrisDirect, then CSFBDirect, then ETrade!</p>

<p>And boy, was it worth the wait. With ETrade&rsquo;s quarterly inactivity fees, I could lose money without having to make any trades! When I decided to close my account, well there&rsquo;s no clear indication how to do that on the otherwise clear and well-organized web site, I called the number on my paper statement, and the rep kindly informed me that I would be charged a withdrawal fee. I got a check, and, for several months, a statement listing a $.04 balance. Perhaps it was a mistake, perhaps they want to keep as many subscribers as possible on the books (it&rsquo;s still a dot-com company, after all).</p>

<p>In any case, I called again and said the account was supposed to be closed. And, just to be sure, I asked &ldquo;and you&rsquo;re going to send me the four-cent balance?&rdquo; The rep&rsquo;s response - &ldquo;Oh, you want that?&rdquo; I just said yes instead of asking whether ETrade was a charity or so desperate they had to embezzle pennies off their customers, so she spent several minutes apparently processing the check request and finally said &ldquo;well, the system&rsquo;s down so I can&rsquo;t give you a confirmation number, but I assure you the check will be sent out.&rdquo; That was about three months ago.</p>
