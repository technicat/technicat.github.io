<p><a href="http://itunes.apple.com/app/fugu-maze/id295808255?mt=8">Fugu Maze 2.1</a> showed up on the App Store yesterday (only a two-day approval period from Apple!). The photo selector has returned (with camera support), via the Etcetera plugin from <a href="http://prime31.com/">Prime31 Studios</a>. Here, I tested the camera support with my takeout dinner (the fries and beans accompanying my garlic butter shrimp from <a href="http://theseafoodzone.com/">The Seafood Zone</a>, formerly with the more interesting name of Guty&rsquo;s Mariscos, but hey, I understand&hellip;it&rsquo;s all about marketing!)</p>
