<p>I&rsquo;m one of those Lisp loyalists who goes on and on about how I did this and that in Lisp and why do we have to mess around with all these newfangled languages when we had all those features in Lisp way back when (see my dated <a href="http://technicat.com/writing/lisp.html">whinging</a>). But I&rsquo;m not enough of a loyalist to actually stick with Lisp (unless you count a tiny bit of Emacs customization). I still have my copy of <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/Groups/AI/html/cltl/cltl2.html">CLtL2</a>, but it&rsquo;s buried under a stack of books on Python, Ruby, C#, Java, Javascript, Actionscript&hellip;.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, there are still some Lisp practitioners plugging away. For example a friend of mine, Shiro Kawai, has implemented <a href="http://practical-scheme.net/gauche/">Gauche Scheme</a>, intended for system scripting and accompanied by a number of extensions, such as OpenGL bindings. This is intriguing - the first Lisp I learned was Scheme in the now defunct <a href="http://ocw.mit.edu/OcwWeb/Electrical-Engineering-and-Computer-Science/6-001Spring-2005/CourseHome/">6.001 course</a>, then I learned Zetalisp and Symbolics Common Lisp on the Symbolics Lisp Machines. So when I moved on to Lucid and Franz Lisp on Sun workstations and Windows PC&rsquo;s, the implementations seemed a) huge and b) somewhat removed from the OS. Meanwhile, with scripting languages like Perl, Python and Tcl showing up, I wondered why we couldn&rsquo;t script in Lisp? (A decade later, I&rsquo;m asking the same question about game scripting languages) The Gauche-GL extension also makes me think all those GLUT demos could be done in Gauche-GL</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t speak Japanese, but I&rsquo;m sure Shiro explains theÂ  possibilities better in this Google Talk.</p>
