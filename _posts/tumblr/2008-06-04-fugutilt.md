The latest version of [FuguTilt](http://www.apple.com/downloads/dashboard/games/fugutilt.html), my first [Unity](http://unity3d.com/) game, was listed as an [Apple Staff Pick](http://www.apple.com/downloads/dashboard/) today. New stuff: dynamic shadows using [shadow maps](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadow_mapping), and a new font from [MacXWare](http://www.macxware.com/site/index.html)’s [FontLibrary](http://www.macxware.com/site/products/FontLibrary/overview.html)

Originally, I made a point of keeping all my Mac widgets as small as possible, under 1MB, which was kind of an interesting exercise. But I’ve given up on that (especially after adding sound), so now I’m trying to pretty it up a bit.
