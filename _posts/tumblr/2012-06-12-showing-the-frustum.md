Well, I don’t know if this is something that’s changed, but I thought that selecting a Camera in the Unity Editor would display its frustum, but here, it didn’t:

Then I realized it would show up, along with the camera preview, if I opened the Camera component of the camera object.

So, good tip to remember.
