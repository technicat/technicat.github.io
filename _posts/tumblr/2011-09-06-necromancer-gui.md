Just a followup to my previous blog post, in which I showed some screenshots of the [Necromancer GUI](http://forum.unity3d.com/threads/80174-Necromancer-GUI-Skin) with the old pause menu script I posted in the Unify wiki. The [Necromancer GUI package](http://u3d.as/content/ironbound-studios/necromancer-gui/1Ax) actually includes a nifty script that showcases the GUI skin. Just create a new Unity project, download/import the Necromancer GUI package, drag the script onto the camera, hit Play.
