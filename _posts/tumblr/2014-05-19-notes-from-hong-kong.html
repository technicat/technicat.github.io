<p>OK, I&rsquo;ve been back in the states about a month, now, so I should say something about what I learned over six months in Hong Kong:</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s crowded. New York City is spacious in comparison. Seriously, I&rsquo;m looking at New Yorkers and wondering why are they rambling around like they have all the space in the world? In Hong Kong, I was always ready to go back to my apartment after a few hours outside.</p>

<p>Apartments are small. After a few hours in my apartment, I was ready to go back outside. But I enjoyed watching their house-hunting shows. The apartments are something out of Get Smart - lots of stuff folding into walls. My apartment had a TV that swiveled between the bed and living room portions.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s hard to find a bathtub. This is generally true in Asia. I had to get an &ldquo;executive&rdquo; room in Taiwan to get a bathtub. But the showers are great - they typically have the regular shower head and a &ldquo;rainfall&rdquo; shower head.</p>

<p>Coming from California, it&rsquo;s refreshing to hear no talk about water conservation (although it actually is an issue), and for once I had no dry skin problems. But it sure is humid.</p>

<p>Go in the fall. Weather was great when I went there in October. Kind of went downhill from December on.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not just the humidity and heat, it&rsquo;s the pollution. Remember the smog alerts that used to plague Southern California? It&rsquo;s like that all the time. A lot of it blows in from China. So it could be worse (it is, in China).</p>

<p>So there&rsquo;s a bit of a green movement there. And a democracy movement. You might have assumed Hong Kong is a democracy - well, sort of. It&rsquo;s got this weird setup stemming from how the British just said, you can be a democracy now, just as they handed Hong Kong to China. So now the &ldquo;pan democrats&rdquo; are campaigning for &ldquo;universal suffrage&rdquo; which basically means the people get to nominate candidates and not just a committee, and China is like, sure, we&rsquo;ll talk, but we&rsquo;re gonna want to screen the candidates (they have to &ldquo;love China&rdquo;), if this Occupy Central movement gets out of hand, we do have an army ready (remember Tianamen Square? Probably not since the history&rsquo;s been wiped), and isn&rsquo;t it about time you guys implemented an &ldquo;anti-subversion&rdquo; law?</p>

<p>In that same vein, there&rsquo;s been a lot of pressure on the press, lately. Bunch of editors and journalists got canned at suspiciously the same time, and a couple even got attacked by triad members from the mainland. The police chief rather too quickly announced the attacks had nothing to do with their work.</p>

<p>The police suck. An Indonesian &ldquo;domestic helper&rdquo; (the Hong Kong version of a maid or nanny, required to live in the employer&rsquo;s residence, not allowed to apply for permanent residency, booted out of the country in a couple of weeks if they can&rsquo;t find another job - on the other hand, still better than the Middle East&hellip;) was tortured by her employer for several months and then dumped at the airport, where another domestic helper found her and got her to a hospital in Indonesia. The police visited the employer, did nothing (which was what they did with a previous complaint lodged against that same employer) and only when Indonesia, the home country that originally pimped her out, raised a fuss, visited again to find that the employer was on the lam, heading to the airport to fly to Thailand. Somehow, the chief executive of Hong Kong thought that stopping her just before she got on the flight constituted great police work.</p>

<p>I understand the convenience of having domestic help, especially in a country that has no child care for working moms and there&rsquo;s a tradition of having elderly parents live with their children. But with laws that turn them into indentured servants, predatory employment agencies that take huge commissions from them, and even the UN admonishing Hong Kong&rsquo;s practices, the situation should be embarrassing. But people just take it for granted. I heard plenty about saving the environment and rescuing animals and promoting democracy, but squat about domestic helpers.</p>

<p>That situation might change if there was more Western coverage, but as far as I can tell that case was mentioned for about five seconds in the CNN and Bloomberg news I watched at three in the morning. The democracy stuff gets no coverage, either. Once in a while, an interviewer will slow pitch a question like how do you feel about government censorship? And, since when you&rsquo;re censored you probably can&rsquo;t say much about being censored, they say, look at the NSA - see, everyone does it! (I sure miss the high ground - the view was nice up there)</p>

<p>OK, enough politics, that just gets depressing. Trying to learn the language can get depressing, too. Think Mandarin with it&rsquo;s four tones is confusing? Try six for Cantonese (or up to nine or ten depending on your definition of &ldquo;tone&rdquo;). And unlike Mandarin, Cantonese tones are relative to each other, e.g., there&rsquo;s a high-flat, middle flat and low flat tone. I used to get annoyed when people said that Cantonese was a &ldquo;musical&rdquo; language, but yeah, it is.</p>

<p>However, the hardest part, as with Mandarin, is learning, or rather, memorizing, the written language. It makes you appreciate the alphabet. I stopped in South Korea on the way back and thought, this language is easy - it has an alphabet! (and it&rsquo;s an alphabet that was systematically designed on commission just a few centuries ago so Koreans wouldn&rsquo;t have to learn Chinese characters, so it looks kind of like a language designed by a science fiction writer)</p>

<p>In Hong Kong, you can actually get away with just English, but some Cantonese can help in certain areas, especially in food courts that cater to the locals. I would like to go back for another six months just so I can learn the rest of the menu (I got through about twenty percent of the nearby food court dishes). But only in the near future. If I wait too long, I fear it&rsquo;ll all be Mandarin and instead of six channels of state TV I&rsquo;ll be watching all censored, all the time (Must Censor TV?)</p>
