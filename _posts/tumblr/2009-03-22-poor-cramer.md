I was unable to stomach watching the entire Jim Cramer interview on [The Daily Show](http://thedailyshow.com/), so I may have missed parts where Jon Stewart didn’t look like he was kicking a dog.&nbsp;

I won’t &nbsp;go as far as Stewart to say they’re in bed with the financial institutions, but with their big-money adoration and CEO fawning, they sure look like the want to be. But while Cramer is more exuberant than anyone else on his network, it should be noted he states repeatedly in his show and in his books that no one who’s unwilling to spend an hour/stock/day should trade individual stocks. Sure, he may be hyperbolic when extolling stocks, but he’s probably hyperbolic when ordering fries - that’s his personality. It’s pretty depressing to see him subdued. Stewart, on the other hand, while he said both of them were snake oil salesmen but his network advertises itself as such, looks hypocritical when he drops his satirical shield and expresses moral outrage. He stated his attacks weren’t at Cramer personally, then showed some clips portraying Cramer in a bad light, and then when Cramer tried to defend himself, Stewart chastised him with “this isn’t about you.” Now, how many people get their news from his show? How often has Cramer been a guest (I’m actually not sure, but I know I’ve seen him on the Colbert Nation). Stewart is as late to this story as anyone else. And after CNBC started shows hosted by John MacEnroe, Donald Trump and Howie Mandel, who could really take them seriously? In a comedy show, moral outrage is best expressed as mock outrage, or mock not-outrage, as finely tip-toed on [The Colbert Nation](http://colbertnation.com/).
