<p>Well, this YouTube monetization feature is already more trouble than its worth, particularly when I try to enable it on videos of my own apps. First I got this email from them:
</p><blockquote>
<table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td valign="middle">Thanks for submitting your videos for monetization. We have disabled monetization on the following videos because we were not able to verify that you have the appropriate commercial use rights for all included content:
<ul><li>&ldquo;HyperBowl for the iPhone and iPad&rdquo;

<a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/bin/request.py?video_id=Wm3rTr_54y8&amp;contact_type=revenue_share&amp;hl=en-US">Submit documentation for this video</a></li>
	<li>&ldquo;Fugu Dance&rdquo;

<a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/bin/request.py?video_id=xYqefzUzSJk&amp;contact_type=revenue_share&amp;hl=en-US">Submit documentation for this video</a></li>
</ul>
 

If you can provide documentation that you have the necessary commercial use rights for all elements in your video, please take a moment to learn <a href="http://support.google.com/youtube/bin/answer.py?answer=1311196&amp;hl=en-US">how to claim rights to a video</a>, and then submit documentation using the links above.</td>

So I responded that I created the apps shown in those videos. And I got this reply:
<blockquote>Thanks for submitting your video for monetization. We need you to provide documentation proving you own the necessary commercial use rights to all sound recordings, musical compositions.

Simply stating that you own the rights to the content may not be sufficient. You must be as specific as possible whenever asked to make a claim on a video.

- If you created your own music, please provide the following information: Artist, Song, Music Composer/Lyricist/Publisher, Music Label (if any)/your relationship with Music Label, Rights Owner’s Name and Contact Information, Your Name (first/last).

- If you created original music or visuals from software, please provide the name of the software and a link to its license terms.

- If you used stock music or visuals from software, please provide the name of the software and a link to its license terms.

- If you used royalty-free music, please provide the following information: Name of the track, Artist of the track, Direct URL of the track, Link to the license terms.

- If an unsigned group or your friend gave you permission to use their song, please provide written consent for your commercial use from the copyright owner(s).

- If your video includes any third party music, sound effects or visuals, please provide us with the source and license terms.

So, forget it. I did reply that I&rsquo;m not going to track down documentation for every single thing that they might conceivably object to, &ldquo;be specific&rdquo; should apply both ways - it would have been nice if they had mentioned music as their objection in the first place, and by the way, whenever I got a notice from them that rumblefish has a claim on music in one of my videos, there is a conspicuous lack of specificity and documentation.

I always feel like I&rsquo;m dealing with bureaucratic robots at Google (especially with YouTube). And seeing as it&rsquo;s Google, maybe I really am.
