<p>I found this evidence on the net of my short-lived career as an MIT journalist. I forgot how much fun rush week was - basically, after you get flushed out of a couple of jock fraternities, you run around campus and try out all the activities, like the student newspaper, <a href="http://tech.mit.edu/">The Tech</a>. So for one night of paste-up, I&rsquo;m listed here with the rather well known tech writer <a href="http://simson.net/page/Bio">Simson Garfinkel</a>.</p>
