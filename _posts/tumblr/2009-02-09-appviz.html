<p>Although I&rsquo;ve been pretty happy checking my App Store download stats with <a href="http://blog.fieryferret.com/2008/10/appstore-clerk.html">AppStore Clerk</a> (after all, it&rsquo;s free), there&rsquo;s nothing like a pretty graph, so I gave the demo of <a href="http://www.apple.com/downloads/macosx/development_tools/appviz.html">AppViz</a> a try.</p>

<p>Here are the sales for <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=295808255&amp;mt=8">FuguMaze</a>, which I launched free, but then started charging for it after 20,000 downloads in the first week. You can pretty much tell from the graph when I started charging.<br/>

<p>Upgrades are tallied separately - it would be nice to have a combined graph that shows all downloads.</p>

<p>A feature I have mixed feelings about - downloading reviews. But with some detachment, they can be entertaining, and sometimes helpful.</p>

I&rsquo;ve made one upgrade, and you can probably tell from the sales and update graphs when that happened.</p>
