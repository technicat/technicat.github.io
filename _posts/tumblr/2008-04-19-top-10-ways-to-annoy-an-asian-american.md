On a recent visit to Bend, Oregon, a resident there assumed I wasn’t from this country. I haven’t experienced much of that since I moved to California years ago, so, oh, that brought back some memories. Here’s a top 10 list, in no particular order.

1. _“Welcome to America!”_ From a heavily tattooed gentleman in Bend who then offered to sell me some weed.
2. _“Where are you from?”_ This is a classic.
3. _“Where are you really from?”_ Follow-on to number 2.
4. _“Are you from Japan?”_ An oddly-specific variation.
5. _Handing me an English-as-a-Second-Language flyer._ On the main steps of MIT.
6. _“Do you speak English?”_ What if I said no?
7. _“How long have you lived in this country?”_ I usually give my age.
8. _“You people are very polite and hard-working.”_ Shut up, I’m napping.
9. _“You guys hate Koreans, right?”_ Whaaa?
10. _Gibberish apparently intended to resemble Chinese_. Heard from children, punks in Boston, and an occasional NBA player.
