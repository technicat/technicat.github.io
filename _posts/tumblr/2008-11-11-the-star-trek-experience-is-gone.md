I thought I’d take a refresher visit to [The Star Trek Experience](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_trek_experience) on my next trip to Las Vegas, but when I looked for the web site, turns out it’s [shut down](http://www.cnn.com/2008/TRAVEL/09/01/star.trek.voyage.ending.ap/index.html)!

My first and last visit was seven years ago, so I missed out on any additions related to the most recent series, Enterprise. But I recall an extensive Federation history along the walkway into the “event”, then a Federation officer escorted everyone into a lift to start a tour, the lights went out as the ship was attacked (during which someone grabbed my shirt from behind - I thought that was part of the act, but it turned out to be a little girl who was afraid of the dark), we ended up on the bridge where the captain explained the situation, and we were seated in a motion simulator ride during a space battle. Afterwards, I wound down by browsing the Trek accessory stores while a Klingon insulted me (I picked up a life-sized [Seven of Nine](http://www.sevenofnineb.org/) for a friend - don’t ask) and a Ferengi served some&nbsp; me some Klingon ale and a mysterious green dish at Quark’s restaurant while muttering something about “hoomons”.

Here’s one of the shorter YouTube snippets of the tour:

and one of the videos on the “decomissioning” ceremony:
