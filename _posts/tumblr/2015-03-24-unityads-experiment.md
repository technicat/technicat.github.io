This is how my switch to UnityAds has gone so far. I think I’m doing better with banner ads (at least partly because I’m only showing UnityAds when the app is starting up vs. ever-present banner ads) and Apple is rejecting any submission when an ad shows a Google Play or Amazon Appstore badge (Unity is winnowing those out, but there are still some there). So on iOS I plan to switch back to iAd, and an Android I might switch back to AdMob if Google stops making me submit my tax info every month. And then I’ll put UnityAds on the HyperBowl Pro app that&nbsp;‘s constantly pirated. So there, ads for everyone.
