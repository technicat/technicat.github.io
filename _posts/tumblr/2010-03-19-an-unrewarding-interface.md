Putting together a hugely bad user interface is hard work - it requires painstaking assembly of numerous small bad interfaces. Recently, I received an email containing my World Market Rewards ID (are there any stores left where they you can just buy something without donating yourself to a database?) and a link to a confirmation page. In most online registrations, I can just click the link and I’m done. Here, you have to enter the code they emailed you, but you can’t even cut-and-paste it - the fields are separated so you have to type it in as if you’re entering a serial number for Microsoft Windows. I’m in no hurry to receive “more special offers”, so I’ve let it sit, while they send me reminders to finish my registration.
