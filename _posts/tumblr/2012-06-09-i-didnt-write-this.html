<p>In theory I don&rsquo;t mind working with experienced editors. In practice, I feel like people messed up my text, sometimes to the point where it&rsquo;s terrible and I worry people think I write that badly. Look at the product description for my Elektra Dance app on the Amazon Appstore:</p>

<p>The bulleted list is not bad, though &ldquo;3D-like&rdquo; is a weird term. The summary below is painful to read - it doesn&rsquo;t exactly have the snap of ad copy, nor the flow of experienced writing. Instead, it appears to be a tediously spelled-out explanation of technical concepts as recently learned from wikipedia. So who writes this stuff? I don&rsquo;t know, but all I can say is, I didn&rsquo;t write it.</p>
