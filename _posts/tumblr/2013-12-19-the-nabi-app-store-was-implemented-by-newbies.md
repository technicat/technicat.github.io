There are several contenders for worst app store administration, but I think I have to give the nod to the Nabi store. It was already in contention due to we-didn’t-even-try elements such as screenshot sizes and aspect ratios that don’t match the Nabi screens! But just now I tried to change my address, and they have it set up so that changing the address also requires changing your ID details. If you don’t make any change, it complains you have to set a new password. If you switch to Password to set a new password it complains the email address is already taken. Meanwhile, my address is mistakenly set to Alabama.
