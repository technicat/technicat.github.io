<p>I decided to perform some long-overdue housecleaning on the <a href="http://hyperbowl3d.com/">HyperBowl</a> assets today. When I first started porting HyperBowl to Unity, I copied all the textures and sounds that looked like they might be used, but only a portion of them really are. This takes up unnecessary on my dev machine, especially when I copy branches of the project for other platforms (webplayer, iOS, Android&hellip;) and extra work if when I make platform-specific adjustments to the assets (e.g. I compress all audio files for webplayers, but not other platforms).</p>

<p>There is no convenient indication in the Unity Editor about what assets are used, but short of inspecting all the gameobjects in every scene or writing a fancy Editor script, you can check after the fact when performing a build, by inspecting the Unity Editor log file. First bring up Console from the Unity Window menu:</p>

<p>Then click on Open Editor Log:</p>

<p><a href="http://itshardtofondlepenguins.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Screen-shot-2011-05-04-at-10.36.58-AM.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4512" title="Screen shot 2011-05-04 at 10.36.58 AM" src="http://itshardtofondlepenguins.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Screen-shot-2011-05-04-at-10.36.58-AM.png" alt="" width="432" height="73"/></a></p>

<p>The log will list the assets included in the most recent build:</p>
