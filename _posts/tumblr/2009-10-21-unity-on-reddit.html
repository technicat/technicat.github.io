<p>The official <a href="http://blogs.unity3d.com/2009/10/20/unity-on-the-web-using-reddit-to-keep-track/">Unity blog</a> reported a number of new reddit categories for tracking Unity blogs, tutorials, sites and games. I just added <a href="http://hyperbowl3d.com/">HyperBowl</a> to the games category, and HiggyB added this blog (maybe it&rsquo;s time I added a &ldquo;Unity&rdquo; category here).</p>

<p>Out of curiosity, I checked if I had any other pages listed on reddit. It turns out there are just a few <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/all//search?q=fugutalk">fugutalk results </a>(and the only one that garnered any fuss was about design patterns, natch). More <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/all//search?q=technicat">reddit results for technicat</a>, though, including one for my <a href="http://technicat.com/games/unity.html">Unity page</a> (specifically, the PDF version) which is slowly starting to resemble a tutorial. I was wondering why that was getting downloaded a lot, recently.</p>
