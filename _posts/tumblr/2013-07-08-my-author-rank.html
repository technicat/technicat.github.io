<p>Another neat feature of Amazon&rsquo;s Author Central is the Author Rank, based on all your book sales on amazon.com (still, there&rsquo;s no way to get kindle book sales numbers, for some reason, except for self-published ebooks). I think each of those big spikes below resulted from one purchase of my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00703SOLC">essay book</a>. The leveling up starting in April must be from presales (and recently, sales) of my <a href="http://learnunity4.com/">Unity book</a>. Cool, I made it to the top 100,000! (and it looks like there are over 500,000 authors?)</p>
