My latest attempt at monetizing my mobile apps (I’m way behind, only using iAds and AdMob so far) is the addition of [Kiip](http://kiip.me/) Rewards to [Fugu Maze](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/hyperbowl/id344209253) on the App Store. The idea is, instead of seeing a banner ad through the whole game or sporadic full-screen (interstitial) ads, you get a little banner popup after completing an achievement or high score that, if tapped on, emails you a coupon, like this (from my testing):

I’ll have to wait and see how the revenue turns out, but the integration was pretty easy and the developer dashboard is polished. And it’s nice to see they have their Unity SDK on [github](https://github.com/kiip/unity-wrapper)!
