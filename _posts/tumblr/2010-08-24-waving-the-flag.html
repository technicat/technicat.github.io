<p>There&rsquo;s been furor in the past over flag-burning, but to me, the real desecration of the flag occurs when people co-opt it for their own causes. I was recently nauseated by a Facebook campaign against the proposed Muslim worship center in New York, largely by the use of the American Flag as their logo. But I should get over it - the tactic is pretty much a cliche by now.</p>

<p>For example, here is an over-the-top logo for the <a href="http://hbpoa.org/">Huntington Beach Police Officers Association</a>:</p>

<p><a href="http://itshardtofondlepenguins.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Screen-shot-2010-08-24-at-12.25.21-PM.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3759" title="Screen shot 2010-08-24 at 12.25.21 PM" src="http://itshardtofondlepenguins.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Screen-shot-2010-08-24-at-12.25.21-PM.png" alt="" width="317" height="329"/></a></p>

<p>A more clever use is on the &ldquo;about us&rdquo; page of the <a href="http://videogamevoters.org/">Video Game Voters Network</a>:</p>

<p><a href="http://itshardtofondlepenguins.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Screen-shot-2010-08-24-at-12.24.08-PM.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3758" title="Screen shot 2010-08-24 at 12.24.08 PM" src="http://itshardtofondlepenguins.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Screen-shot-2010-08-24-at-12.24.08-PM.png" alt="" width="632" height="390"/></a></p>

<p>Nowhere does it explain on that page that the group is founded and run by the <a href="http://www.theesa.com/">ESA</a>, the industry group representing game publishers. That type of omission leads the conspiracy theorist in me (and I didn&rsquo;t even know I had one) to wonder who was behind the anonymous mass mailings in the<a href="http://igda.org/"> IGDA</a> that led to Tim Langdell&rsquo;s ouster. Anyway, for my civil liberties advocacy, I&rsquo;ll count on organizations like the <a href="http://aclu.org/">ACLU</a> - at least I know who they are.</p>

<p>And liberal groups are not immune, either. <a href="http://moveon.org/">MoveOn</a> exercises this tactic (and others normally attributed to Fox News), but with a bit of subtlety here - they have some stars and stripes sneaking in around the borders and background:</p>

<p><a href="http://itshardtofondlepenguins.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Screen-shot-2010-08-24-at-12.26.38-PM.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3760" title="Screen shot 2010-08-24 at 12.26.38 PM" src="http://itshardtofondlepenguins.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Screen-shot-2010-08-24-at-12.26.38-PM.png" alt="" width="533" height="343"/></a></p>

<p>It&rsquo;s an unseemly replacement for discourse. Which flag is bigger, yours or mine?</p>
