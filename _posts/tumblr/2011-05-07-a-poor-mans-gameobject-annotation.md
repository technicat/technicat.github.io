My latest Unity cheap trick - annotating game objects by appending annotations to their names. This scheme does have the advantage of showing the annotation in the Hierarchy view. For example, the menu scene in [HyperBowl](http://hyperbowl3d.com/) has a Quit button not appropriate for the iOS version, so I marked it to-delete when I make the next branch copy for an iOS build.
