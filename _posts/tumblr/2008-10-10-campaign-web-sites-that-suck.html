<p>Hooray, no more presidential campaign coverage for me, now that I sent in my vote-by-mail ballot. Now I return to watching recycled sitcoms during the news hours, satisfied that I have intelligently cast my votes after googling all the candidates. Local races are still a problem, though, so initially, I considered just voting for anyone who actually had a web site (hey, it&rsquo;s an improvement over my previous tactic of just guessing or leaving the whole slate blank). But some web sites are worse than none. The site of <a href="http://johnbriscoe.com/">John Briscoe</a> could be a candidate for <a href="http://websitesthatsuck.com/">Web Sites That Suck</a>:</p>

<p>The full extent of this site&rsquo;s awfulness is not conveyed in the screenshot. The blue New graphic rotates, the arrow graphic wiggles horizontally, and the grey splotches are flashing &ldquo;New&rdquo; graphics reminiscent of the notorious blink tag. To top it off, the issue statements are only viewable with the Windows Media Player.</p>
