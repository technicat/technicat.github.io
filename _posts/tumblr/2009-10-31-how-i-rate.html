<p>Some of the App Store ratings I&rsquo;ve received puzzle me. For example, there&rsquo;s the person who game me a one-star rating and called my app the worst ever (that&rsquo;s hard to believe - out of 85,000 apps?), but then when I checked that reviewer&rsquo;s other ratings, all were just one star  or five stars. A binary reviewer. Another one-star review was actually a rave review except for a complaint that I didn&rsquo;t support pre-OS 3.0 - it promised an upgrade to five stars if I rectified that. (and to add insult to injury, I think both of those reviewers used promo codes - they didn&rsquo;t even have to pay for it).

On the other hand, I&rsquo;ve been the beneficiary of five-star ratings, too, so it probably cancels out and I probably shouldn&rsquo;t look too closely or obsess about it. But that has made me consider I should be more conscious about how I rate other apps. It&rsquo;s not exactly a formula, but I do have some rules of thumb:
</p><ul><li>A few apps don&rsquo;t even run. Those get one star (&ldquo;avoid&rdquo;)</li>
	<li>Some apps are so obnoxious in some way that I remove them immediately. One star.</li>
	<li>An app with any redeeming feature gets at least two stars (&ldquo;adequate&rdquo;)</li>
	<li>An app that requires you to login to some kind of internet account just to get past the first screen is two stars.</li>
	<li>An app that has had decent work done on it, not slap-dash work, gets at least three stars (&ldquo;OK/average&rdquo;)</li>
	<li>An app that has repeatable playability/usability, that you want to promote, tell your friends about, gets at least four stars (&ldquo;good&rdquo;)</li>
	<li>An app that has ads will lose a star - it&rsquo;s never unobtrusive, and to put it another way, ad-less apps should be rewarded. I deducted two stars from one app that had flickering ads on the screen during gameplay - the equivalent of flashing web banner ads.</li>
	<li>An app that is so good or useful that I try to avoid deleting it when making room for new apps gets five stars.</li>
</ul>
I&rsquo;m not saying it&rsquo;s a great system, but it&rsquo;s a system. Maybe the biggest defect is that it doesn&rsquo;t consider price - shouldn&rsquo;t a great free app somehow rate higher than a great $10 app? Also, this isn&rsquo;t a problem with my rating system so much as the Apple rating interface - I only bother rating apps when I delete them, so my least-favorite apps have the greatest probability of getting their ratings, while my favorite apps never get their deserved five stars. A stat I would really like to see? app-lifetime-on-device.
