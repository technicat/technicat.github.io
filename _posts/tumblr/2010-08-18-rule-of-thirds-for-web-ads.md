I have a rule of thirds when it comes to web ads (along with a rule of popups and a rule of flashing banner ads) - I am not inclined to tweet/share/inflict a web page on others if two thirds of the page doesn’t consist of content. Like this Forbes page, which has a story surrounded by blocks of large type blaring at you to sign up for other Forbes products.

You could argue that ads promoting other Forbes products or promotions or tie-ins qualify as Forbes content (at least on my own web site, that’s the story I’m sticking with). But the reason I got peeved is at the bottom of the page, where it’s clear the entire story might have fit on this page if they’d given it, say, maybe 40% of the page.

To be fair, I’ve seen a lot worse. Indeed, I’ve followed twitter links to articles which just had one or a few sentences, surrounded by a sea of ads, requiring you to click on a link to read more of the story. Eventually, they’ll just feed us a word at a time.
