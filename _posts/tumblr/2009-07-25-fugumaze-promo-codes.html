<p>I tried out the App Store promo code feature, where you can request a limited number of promo codes for each app release to distribute for, well, promotional purposes. And I&rsquo;ve got to say, it&rsquo;s a hassle. One review site sent me email requesting one or more codes, but with the disclaimer that they may or may not bother to review the app. Nice racket. On another site, after I responded to a post, a forum member sent me a private message requesting a code, so I decided to be democratic about it and posted a set on the forum. It&rsquo;s like watching college students or starving artists - once they see a freebie, they want one too. After the initial set ran out, one guy said he couldn&rsquo;t try out the app because the all the promo codes were taken. He &ldquo;couldn&rsquo;t&rdquo; pay $.99? I can understand that he &ldquo;wouldn&rsquo;t&rdquo; pay, considering he posted several times and took every opportunity to trash all of my other work, which seemed oddly aggressive and off-topic to me (I&rsquo;ve got to wonder if he was a former co-worker), but really, if he was so certain that he wouldn&rsquo;t like the app, why take a promo code from someone who might actually appreciate it? I posted my remaining codes, and was rewarded with a review, true to form, that he didn&rsquo;t like it, but it wasn&rsquo;t as crappy as my other work. Gee, thanks. You must be great at dinner parties.</p>

<p>But that&rsquo;s the Internet for you - it&rsquo;s the ultimate gathering place for personality disorders (instead of that weird &ldquo;I am a PC campaign, Microsoft should just showcase the semi-literate reviews on the App Store. So much for the &quot;creative class&rdquo;), but there is good with the bad - I got some reviews with constructive suggestions, and I see that promo codes are a useful tool for jump-starting reviews and downloads of a new app. After all, I do grab those iTunes coupons every time I visit Starbucks. It looks like the trend these days however is to deploy a &ldquo;lite&rdquo; version of an app to drive users to the paid version. I tried a variation for FuguMaze, probably with less long-term effectiveness, by releasing it free initially, and after seeing 20,000 downloads in the first week, moving it up to $.99. The sales dropped sharply, but by then, it had plenty of reviews.</p>

<p>So here are the remaning FuguMaze promo codes for the latest release, good for another three weeks or so. First come, first served!</p>
