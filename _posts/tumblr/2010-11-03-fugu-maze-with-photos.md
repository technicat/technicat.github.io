[Fugu Maze 2.1](http://itunes.apple.com/app/fugu-maze/id295808255?mt=8) showed up on the App Store yesterday (only a two-day approval period from Apple!). The photo selector has returned (with camera support), via the Etcetera plugin from [Prime31 Studios](http://prime31.com/). Here, I tested the camera support with my takeout dinner (the fries and beans accompanying my garlic butter shrimp from [The Seafood Zone](http://theseafoodzone.com/), formerly with the more interesting name of Guty’s Mariscos, but hey, I understand…it’s all about marketing!)
