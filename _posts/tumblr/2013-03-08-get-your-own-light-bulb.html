<p>I&rsquo;m somewhat surprised that the habit most objected to in my Seven Habits of Highly Effective Programmers essay is Don&rsquo;t Ask Stupid Questions, particularly the emphasis on doing your own research first. The common rejoinder is &ldquo;It&rsquo;s faster if I ask someone else.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The responses that threaten to burst forth include &ldquo;That&rsquo;s just rude&rdquo;, &ldquo;Your time is more valuable than mine?&rdquo; and &ldquo;Learning how to find this information is a professional skill you should develop (dumbass)&rdquo;.</p>

<p>When logic (and insults) fail to persuade, we resort to analogies, which if they fail to enlighten, at least leave one party feeling wise and the other mystified. Let me try this old college story on you: I lived on the fifth floor of my dorm, which had no elevator, so, like a squirrel burying nuts for the winter, I would ask for an extra light bulb at the front desk so that I wouldn&rsquo;t have to trudge down the stairs the next time my desk lamp went out. My neighbor had a better strategy. When his light bulb burned out, he would just take mine. So, are you that guy?</p>
