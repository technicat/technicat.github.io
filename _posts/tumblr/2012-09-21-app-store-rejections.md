During the spate of news about Steam’s Greenlight, I saw some stories compare it to Apple’s App Store, saying the latter in not curated, implying that you can pretty much publish what you want, short of illegality. This is a misconception shared by just about everyone who approaches me with an app idea, thinking it’s a low-risk and low-cost endeavor. As Adobe and Google can attest, Apple can and will reject any app it wants to for any reason (now they have published guidelines, but they’re general enough to allow any decision and it’s not like they’re bound by them, anyway).

Here’s a sample of rejection responses I’ve received over the years:

Not enough functionality.  
Too promotional.  
It should be a web app.  
Try HTML5.  
It should be an iBook.  
Less than very good.  
It’s just aggregating web content.  
Not enough native functionality.  
Try integrating maps.  
Should use in-app purchases instead of multiple apps (they gave me a pass on that one)  
Infringes on an Apple trademark, no, resembles Apple marketing material  
Looks too much like the iOS version (OK, that’s from the Mac App Store)

Some of these rejections were for update submissions, i.e. they rejected apps that are already on the store, so in the end, they’re rejecting fixes. So, you never know.
