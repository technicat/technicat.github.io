A long time ago when I was working on a large and ridiculously mis-threaded Java application (back then we said “application”), I removed an animated color display that did nothing. Some people complained, saying they liked it - I figured it was crashing on multicore systems and taking up screen space. But now I’m all about activity indicators that give you the possibly false impression something’s going on - every app should have one. Here’s a Unity C# script I drop into every splash screen that immediately starts an activity indicator (Android or iOS) and kills it after the next level has completed loading.

    public class Spinner : MonoBehaviour { // Use this for initialization void Start () { GameObject.DontDestroyOnLoad(this.gameObject); StartCoroutine(StartActivityIndicator()); } IEnumerator StartActivityIndicator () { #if UNITY\_IPHONE Handheld.SetActivityIndicatorStyle(iOSActivityIndicatorStyle.Gray); #endif #if UNITY\_ANDROID Handheld.SetActivityIndicatorStyle(AndroidActivityIndicatorStyle.InversedLarge); #endif #if UNITY\_IPHONE || UNITY\_ANDROID Handheld.StartActivityIndicator(); #endif yield return null; } void OnLevelWasLoaded() { #if UNITY\_IPHONE || UNITY\_ANDROID Handheld.StopActivityIndicator(); #endif GameObject.Destroy(gameObject); } }
