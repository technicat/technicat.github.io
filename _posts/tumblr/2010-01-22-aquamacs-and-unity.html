<p>I&rsquo;m a long-time emacs user (beginning with Zmacs on the Symbolics Lisp Machines) and I&rsquo;m still holding out, using <a href="http://xemacs.org/">XEmacs</a> on Windows and <a href="http://aquamacs.org/">Aquamac</a>s on MacOSX. But with Unity, I haven&rsquo;t tried changing the default editor, largely out of apathy, and also Unitron is adequate and has a nice auto-coloring feature for Unity functions.</p>

<p>However, one of the &ldquo;Google Friday&rdquo; projects at Unity is an <a href="http://blogs.unity3d.com/2010/01/15/emacs-mode-for-unity-javascript/">Emacs mode for Unity Javascript</a>, so I just had to try it out. First, I specified Aquamacs as my Unity editor:</p>

<p><a href="http://itshardtofondlepenguins.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/unityemacs.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3072" title="unityemacs" src="http://itshardtofondlepenguins.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/unityemacs.png" alt="" width="450" height="205"/></a></p>

<p>Then I downloaded the elisp file from the blog article and placed it in my user Library/Preferences directory for Aquamacs.</p>

<p><a href="http://itshardtofondlepenguins.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/aquamacsprefs.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3073" title="aquamacsprefs" src="http://itshardtofondlepenguins.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/aquamacsprefs.png" alt="" width="341" height="343"/></a></p>

<p>Finally, I placed the loading code specified in the blog article into the Preferences.el file (shown in the same directory above). So far, looks good!</p>
