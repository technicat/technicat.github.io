The official [Unity blog](http://blogs.unity3d.com/2009/10/20/unity-on-the-web-using-reddit-to-keep-track/) reported a number of new reddit categories for tracking Unity blogs, tutorials, sites and games. I just added [HyperBowl](http://hyperbowl3d.com/) to the games category, and HiggyB added this blog (maybe it’s time I added a “Unity” category here).

Out of curiosity, I checked if I had any other pages listed on reddit. It turns out there are just a few [fugutalk results](http://www.reddit.com/r/all//search?q=fugutalk)(and the only one that garnered any fuss was about design patterns, natch). More [reddit results for technicat](http://www.reddit.com/r/all//search?q=technicat), though, including one for my [Unity page](http://technicat.com/games/unity.html) (specifically, the PDF version) which is slowly starting to resemble a tutorial. I was wondering why that was getting downloaded a lot, recently.
