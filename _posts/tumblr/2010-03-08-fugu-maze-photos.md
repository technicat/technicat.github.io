I’ve been unable to google the source of the recent upturn in [Fugu Maze](http://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=295808255&mt=8) sales on the App Store - the most I can tell from my AppViz report is that it might be taking place in Great Britain. And since it has taken place since the most recent app update, I’m going to guess that part of the popularity is due to the photo picker feature (if that’s true, then the Unity iPhone Enhancement Pack has already paid for itself!)

Customizing a maze with your own “wall photo” may be more fun to some than actually solving the maze. Here are some screenshots of my tests, using an old college photo, a picture of my cat, and a baby picture of my nephew.
