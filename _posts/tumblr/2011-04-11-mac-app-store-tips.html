Although I&rsquo;m bailing out of the Mac App Store (I&rsquo;m even going to ask for a refund of the developer fee, really to emphasize my objection to their rejection of <a href="http://hyperbowl3d.com/">HyperBowl</a> - Schoolhouse Rock, anyone? - I wouldn&rsquo;t mind the money back, though), I&rsquo;ve made enough Mac App Store builds to have some tips:

First, read the <a href="http://technology.blurst.com/unity-games-and-mac-app-store/">Blurst blog</a> that explains in detail how to prepare a Unity MacOSX build for the Mac App Store. The procedure involves some tedious details after the Unity build so it&rsquo;s a good idea to script some of it. For example, I have the final steps listed in the Blurst blog in a shell script like this:
<pre>chmod -R a+xr FuguMaze.app
codesign -f -v -s "3rd Party Mac Developer Application: Technicat, LLC" "FuguMaze.app"
productbuild --component "FuguMaze.app" "/Applications" --sign "3rd Party Mac Developer Installer: Technicat, LLC" "FuguMaze.pkg"
</pre>
Also, it&rsquo;s a good idea to make a copy of the final info.plist and icons file outside of the app so it doesn&rsquo;t get clobbered with each build. In fact, the script would be better if it performed a copy of those files into the app and also had a variable in place of the app name so you could use it more easily among multiple apps.
