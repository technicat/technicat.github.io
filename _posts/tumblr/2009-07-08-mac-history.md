I saw a magazine article (the now defunct Conde Nast Portfolio, I think) listing the “worst” CEO’s of all time, and John Sculley made the list. I think that’s unfair. Conventional wisdom has it that he took a great company and tanked it. Conventional wisdom also had it that Apple should have licensed their technology to other companies. Steve Jobs nixed that when he returned, and you don’t hear that criticism, anymore. There was a great product run during the Sculley years, from the original Mac, to the MacSE, the Mac II line, and the Newton. Yeah, I said it, the Newton. C'mon, that was a really cool product. Remember those guys who took over after him? Yeah, neither do I. During those years, and including the first years of Jobs’ return, I pretty much gave up on Apple, thought the OS was going nowhere, didn’t even like the looks of the new models (not even the early iMacs) and I didn’t test the waters again until 2005. And during that whole time, I hated Windows, so it’s not like I was happily programming on something else. But now I’m back in the fold, and after buying my latest MacBook Pro, realize looking back that I haven’t owned as much Mac hardware as I thought, but I’ve been an Apple guy for a long time.

- 1981 - Transferred mid-year to a new junior high school, discovered an Apple II in the school library, went through the AppleSoft Basic tutorials on drawing graphics - suddenly understood the coolness of programming.
- 1982 - Dad purchased an Apple II, started writing Basic programs (wire-frame surface display, pi calculators, Othello) and dabbled in machine language (a word processor, another Othello program) - the latter didn’t work right but ran fast!
- 1983 - First paying programming job, making minor Apple II program fixes for CONDUIT, the university group for educational software. I think they were unimpressed.
- 1984 - My first sight of a Mac, at a friend’s place. Dazzled by MacWrite - fonts! Proportional spacing! Black text on a white background!
- 1985 - Worked at continuing studies center of MIT maintaining their computer lab - all Macs! Used those same Macs to write tech press briefs for a public relations company.
- 1985 - Summer job at the campus computer store - talked with Marvin Minsky over the phone, saw the Apple Lisa, saw the Apple Lisa burn out, sold a bunch of Macs, hated the boss (first bad boss)
- 1994 - After joining a company that had dial-up Internet access (BBN), finally got my own Mac, the model with a DOS card so I could see what the MS fuss was about. Saw Doom, liked Marathon better.
- 1996 - Got a Mac PowerBook from Fry’s, the first in&nbsp; a series of used computers they sold me as new. Opened it to find a partially filled out registration card and System 7 in mid-install (disk 5 out of 10). Otherwise, it was a great computer and allowed local two-player networked Marathon matches.
- 1998 - Purchased a Performa for no good reason. Played Myth, that was about it. System 8 was pretty creaky.&nbsp; Stopped running after a year - I heard that the clock probably just needed a new battery.
- 2005 - Decided to test the Mac waters again with a Mac Mini. I can develop again! Unix, Java, open source tools…but with 256MB just don’t try playing games or running Eclipse.
- 2006 - New contract requires a machine with horsepower, or so I rationalize, so I buy the new MacBook Pro. Good thing - I give up on my DSL provider and end up doing my work at Starbucks.
- 2006 - New contract has a boss who yells a lot. I buy an iPod nano.
- 2007 - 512MB is still painful. Throwing in another 1GB memory card eases the pain.
- 2008 - Now I’m out of disk space. 60GB doesn’t cut it, anymore. Went with the LaCie Rugged in the hope of keeping a device running more than a year.
- 2009 - MacBook Pro, after months of wheezing, starts crashing. Fortunately had Time Machine running with the LaCie - provides near-seamless transition to the replacement, a 13" MacBook Pro. The screen is small, but the price is right (at least, compared to other Macs).
