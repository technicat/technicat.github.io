I thought I’d finally get around to uploading app preview videos on the App Store and in the process only just discovered the iOS video capture capability of iOS 8 and Yosemite. That works great, but after I made a dozen videos, I found iTunesConnect requires the frame rate of the videos to be reduced. So, in the meantime, I’m just uploading them to YouTube…
