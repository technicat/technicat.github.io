<p>Amid all the television news stories on the economic crisis, I saw a report detailing the woes of Canadian carmakers, namely GM Canada, Ford Canada&hellip;apparently there are lower employee costs in a country that doesn&rsquo;t rely on employer-sponsored healthcare. Aside from the competitive disadvantage imposed by the US healthcare system, another thought occurred to me - I&rsquo;ve never heard anyone blame Canada for taking our jobs.</p>

<p>I remember way back in the 80&rsquo;s when Gephardt was campaigning for the presidency and talking up the Japanese scare with auto unions, but I&rsquo;ve never heard a peep about US auto jobs moving to Canada. Ross Perot warned of that sucking sound of jobs going south, not north. I&rsquo;ve heard Lou Dobbs warn about terrorists, disease, criminals and job-stealers crossing the Mexican border but nothing about Canada (to be fair, I don&rsquo;t watch angry white man shows much, so maybe I missed something). When EA shut down it&rsquo;s Seattle office and opened up a new one in Vancouver, the only controversy there was the EA Spouse story, but game outsourcing to China is worth a Game Developer Magazine issue. When the first Mac factory was constructed in Ireland, the story was about how cutting-edge and automated that factory was, while stories about iPod manufacturing in China are about outsourcing to China (OK that&rsquo;s Ireland, not Canada, but somehow Blame Ireland isn&rsquo;t such a catchy blog title).</p>

<p>While aerospace jobs here in Huntington Beach moved to Arizona and a good portion of your favorite TV shows and movies are filmed not in Hollywood but in Canada (where they have rules requiring the hiring of Canadian actors, as I learned on the commentary of Slither), the Orange County Â IT and programming mail lists I subscribed to were filled with whining about Indian programmers taking our jobs. One poster somehow ended with a lament that Mexicans were hard-working and friendly but didn&rsquo;t value education. I could have rejoindered that&rsquo;s what I thought about white people, but actually, a disproportionate number of my programming coworkers have been white people - Europeans and, you guessed it, Canadians.</p>

<p>I know there are a lot of protests and counter-arguments that can be made, and I&rsquo;ve heard them all from the aforementioned mail lists, ranging from I&rsquo;m not a racist to trends&hellip;yada yada&hellip;magnitude&hellip;yada yada&hellip;but all I ask is, if you&rsquo;re hand-wringing about the Chinese and Indians and Mexicans, be fair and just once in a while, blame Canada.</p>
