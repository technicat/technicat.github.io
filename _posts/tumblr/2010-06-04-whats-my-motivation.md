This talk about non-monetary incentives is interesting (and add the sketching, entertaining). I think it leaves a few things out, though. For example, mastery and contribution are mentioned as incentives for Google-Friday and open source types of work. Seems to me ownership is another factor. I’ve worked on a well-acclaimed game with a large team, but it’s still a lot more fun working on my own game project where I decide everything (even though I got paid well for the big project and make squat on my own game).

And the speaker marvels that engineers performing interesting and challenging work at their day jobs are spending time on extra projects. But there’s a big assumption there. I expect tenured academics who have their own schedules and offices and pick their own research projects don’t really understand working at a regular company is a grind, even if the project sounds glamorous. It’s not coal-mining, but sitting in a cubicle all day coding up someone else’s idea of an important feature (or debugging it) while a project manager holding a clipboard keeps asking you “how many hours left on your task?” is why Silicon Valley engineers dream of IPO’s.

The talk characterizes Google Fridays as management “getting out of the way.” You could say employees are extra motivated by this practice, but another way to appraise it is to say that this is what employees would do on their own but management typically demotivates employees. Usually, employees are pretty motivated when they start, and then it goes downhill. I was recently thinking of a former employer who constantly complained about the mediocre output of her employees, and it really did seem that way. But I noticed everyone who left became much more accomplished almost immediately. Now, what’s the variable?
