For a while now, I’ve been paying closer attention to title sequences on TV and in movies, maybe because the rest of the feature is often lame in comparison, or perhaps the dynamic and concise nature of title sequences seems more relevant to the content in my video game work.

But it wasn’t until I read [AGI: Graphic Design Since 1950](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2159943.AGI_Graphic_Design_Since_1950?utm_medium=api&utm_source=blog_book), specifically the article on Saul Bass, that I thought about who creates these sequences - I had assumed it was the same crew that made the entire movie but it’s usually a separate designer or firm specializing in opening title sequences. Saul Bass is yet another graphic designer I’m embarrassed I didn’t know about (the name rings a bell, but that’s not much consolation). Not only was he a pioneer in movie title sequences, he created iconic movie posters (The Man with the Golden Arm and many Hitchcock films) and designed famous corporate logos (e.g. AT&T). Here are some interesting links:

[Wikipedia entry](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saul_Bass) - interesting, but as always, approach with suspicion
