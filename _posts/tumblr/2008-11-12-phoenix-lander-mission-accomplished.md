The daylight savings shift and shortened sunlight hours have messed up my energy level, but Iâ€™m doing well compared to the solar-charged [Mars Phoenix Lander](http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/phoenix/news/phoenix-20081110.html), which, with a recent dust storm and the Martian winter, has basically run out of battery.

It had a good run. Here are a few recent images - a dust devil, view beneath the lander, and an instrument waving in the Martian wind.
