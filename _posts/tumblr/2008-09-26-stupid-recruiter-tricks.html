<p>After the umpteenth annoying recruiter email, I finally turned off resume@technicat.com, the email address on a somewhat dated version of my <a href="http://www.technicat.com/resume/resume.pdf">online resume</a>. I guess email address harvesters don&rsquo;t go through PDF files, since I haven&rsquo;t received much spam on that address, but the recruiters are nearly as annoying:
</p><ul><li>emailing me requests for my email address. Who do they think they&rsquo;re emailing?</li>
	<li>request for my resume in Word format (so they could remove my contact info, one recruiter told me). Don&rsquo;t they know how to cut and paste?</li>
	<li>querying whether I know anyone who might be interested in the position. What am I, a recruiter?</li>
	<li>mailings that are obviously mass-mailings</li>
	<li>mailings of positions that aren&rsquo;t even in my field</li>
	<li>a recruiter mass mailing an announcement during the housing boom that was switching to real estate. Followed a year later by an announcement that he was returning to recruiting.</li>
	<li>a recruiter who claimed the potential employer knew me from a previous company - turned out to be a standard line she used on everyone</li>
	<li>a recruiter who wanted to know why I didn&rsquo;t use recruiters, and then when I replied that they tend to be a waste of time, proceeded to argue with me and waste my time</li>
	<li>a junior recruiter  <a href="http://www.remingtoninternational.com/">Remington International</a> who warned me not to show up late and then kept me waiting for half an hour</li>
	<li>same firm had me enter my info online before the interview, and then I had to re-enter the info on-site because they couldn&rsquo;t figure out how to access it</li>
	<li>same recruiter wanted the name and phone numbers of all my employers so they could solicit new business</li>
	<li>a senior recruiter at <a href="http://www.remingtoninternational.com/">Remington International</a> who told me if I didn&rsquo;t call within a couple of weeks, they would forget about me (at least they were honest about it)</li>
	<li>a recruiter at <a href="http://www.genp.com/">General Employment</a> who was incapable of arranging an interview with more than a few hours notice</li>
	<li>same recruiter, after the boss took over and scheduled an interview, unilaterally decided to lower my asking salary (the originally listed position salary) by $20k. Thanks for the representation!</li>
	<li>a recruiter who wanted to send my resume to multiple employers and, when I said I wanted to hear from the first one, said &ldquo;they haven&rsquo;t returned my call, what am I supposed to do?&rdquo; I don&rsquo;t know - maybe, your job?</li>
	<li>a recruiter at Gravity Tech who rewrote my resume with buzzwords (this is why the want it in Word) so that the interviewer was totally confused. I had to give him a copy of the original I had with me.</li>
	<li>apparently more unmarketing by Gravity Tech, after they asked me for more leads and managed to get my resume rejected from companies that had earlier asked me directly to visit them</li>
	<li>dot com bust - Gravity Tech renames themselves to <a href="http://www.gravitypeople.com/">Gravity People</a></li>
	<li>a recruiter who kept sending me email with no useful information and &ldquo;call me!&rdquo;</li>
	<li>recruiters who want me to apply for a job without knowing what it is (I was floored when a recruiter from <a href="http://www.mary-margaret.com/">Mary Margaret</a> sent me an email actually naming the hiring company)</li>
	<li>on the other side, when I was hiring, a recruiter who decided to just send candidates over whenever he felt like it</li>
</ul>
I can&rsquo;t believe I let these people waste my time all these years.
