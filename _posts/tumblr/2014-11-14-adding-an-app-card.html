<p>OK, I&rsquo;ve figured out how to add an app card to a web site. For my HyperBowl site, I just added a bunch of twitter:card tags as specified in the twitter card doc (do a view source on hyperbowl3d.com to see), previewed it in the twitter card validator web page, which presents a button for you to request adding your site to the twitter card whitelist.</p>

<p>The approval happened pretty much immediately, and ta da, tweeting the HyperBowl web site URL results in some automatically displayed app info in the tweet detail, dependent on which device you&rsquo;re using (displays Google Play if you&rsquo;re on Android, App Store on iOS).</p>

<p>One tip: seems that it requires the twitter card image specified in order to see the app detail when viewing the tweet on twitter.com, even though that image is never displayed (the image is always pulled from the appropriate app store).</p>
