With the original TestFlight disappearing in a week, I’m getting the hang of Apple’s new TestFlight. No longer having to register devices and generate new ad hoc provisioning profiles is a big win, as is the 1000 user limit (compared to the 100 device limit of old TestFlight). There are some gotchas - the TestFlight app requires iOS 8, new builds have to go through Apple review on iTunesConnect (typically a day), during submission old builds are removed from testing, and I had a lot of trouble with one user who was using GMail instead of the regular iOS Mail app, compounded by Columbia University’s mail system filtering out the links on the TestFlight invitation email.
