I never thought I’d say these words, but I was disappointed in Joss Whedon’s new show. D[ollhouse](http://www.fox.com/dollhouse/) had an interesting premise and plenty of sex appeal, but lacked the trademark Whedon humor and quirky characters (maybe because most of them were crammed into one). Perhaps it just needs more time - plenty of other shows, including Lost and The X-Files took a while to grab me.

But in the meantime, that leaves Battlestar Galactica far and above the rest of the pack. There are plenty of good shows on TV, but BSG is the only show that I just have to see (although when it comes to rewatching DVD sets, I’ve gone back the most to Whedon’s Buffy, Angel and Firefly).

Now that the show is in it’s final season, I was gratified to see the [LA Magazine article](http://www.lamag.com/article.aspx?id=12308) confessing to the show’s neglect by critics, and by the Emmy’s (it’s hard for any show with spaceships or vampires to win). I’m doing my part by watching the extras on scifi.com - the [webisodes](http://www.scifi.com/battlestar/webisodes/), “enhanced” [episodes](http://www.scifi.com/rewind/?sid=32850) with commentary, and the highly entertaining [panel discussion](http://www.scifi.com/comiccon/video/index.php?clip=4) from last year’s Comic Con. Plus I recommend visit [Bear McCreary’s blog.](http://bearmccreary.com/)&nbsp;(He also scores the next best show, [The Sarah Connor Chronicles](http://www.fox.com/terminator/)). And&nbsp;I finally put up these Battlestar Galactica posters from [ThinkGeek](http://www.thinkgeek.com/homeoffice/posters/a42d/?cpg=froogle) on my wall. So say we all!
