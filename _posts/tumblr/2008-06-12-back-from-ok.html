<p>I returned from Oklahoma with some cowboy sculpture, a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederic_Remington">Frederic Remington</a> from the<a href="http://www.nationalcowboymuseum.org/"> National Cowboy Museum</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://itshardtofondlepenguins.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/img_0743.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-157" title="img_0743" src="http://itshardtofondlepenguins.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/img_0743.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="375"/></a></p>

<p>Despite my growing collection, I&rsquo;m not really a horse guy (although I remember drawing them frequently as a child, along with the Starship Enterprise and the occasional dinosaur), and I rarely purchase souvenirs, but air travel these days is so annoying, you should have a trophy to show when you arrive home.<!--more--></p>

<p>This trip was a mixed bag. On the United direct flight from <a href="http://www.lawa.org/lax/">LAX</a> to <a href="http://www.flyokc.com/">Will Rogers Airport</a>, a flight attendant gave me extra little jars of jam to take with me, though admittedly the jam was part of a snack package given only to first class (I&rsquo;d taken advantage of a $200 upgrade offer during my online check-in).</p>

<p>On my return flight, I hoped for another chance to upgrade relatively cheaply (the difference at initial reservation time was $1000), but the attendants at the gate studiously ignored me while one of them showed off her daughters to the other.</p>

<p>But you can count on the <a href="http://www.tsa.gov/">TSA</a> to make any airline attendant look like a concierge. I&rsquo;ve found TSA agents in Bend, Oregon consistently professional and courteous. And that&rsquo;s the only place. At <a href="http://www.longbeach.gov/airport/">Long Beach Airport</a>, they&rsquo;re pretty friendly, but one of them spied a book on ancient Chinese history entitled <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/127509.Treason_by_the_Book">Treason by the Book</a> and told me I shouldn&rsquo;t carry that on board (read, much?) LAX is the worst, with rudeness surpassing even that in New York (where I greeted a TSA agent who returned, &ldquo;move on&rdquo;).</p>

<p>I once had an early morning flight from LAX, where I was so frazzled while re-donning my shoes and belt that I didn&rsquo;t realize until I reached the gate that I&rsquo;d left a bag by the security checkpoint. When I went back to inquire, the airport police officer pointed me to the TSA agents, who simply shrugged and said they hadn&rsquo;t seen it. Fifteen minutes later, the police officer tracked me down at the gate to inform me they really did have it - they found it and left it in a corner the whole time. Thumbs up for the LAX police, thumbs down for TSA (those warnings about unattended luggage should say &ldquo;any unattended luggage will be ignored and forgotten by the TSA&rdquo;)</p>

<p>This time around, I handed my boarding pass to the agent on the other side of the screener who was so busy yelling things like &ldquo;I&rsquo;m telling you to come here&rdquo; and &ldquo;Pick up your kid, lady&rdquo; that when she turned around and saw me, she&rsquo;d forgotten if she&rsquo;d assigned me for a pat-down, actually saying &ldquo;Did I tell you to stand here? I forgot.&rdquo; So I got a thorough pat-down, but at least the patter-downer gave me a courteous thank-you. (That&rsquo;s the least I expect, short of dinner and a movie)</p>

<p>Even at Will Rogers, where I&rsquo;d expect some Midwest friendliness, I&rsquo;ve been frisked and sent on my way without so much as a y'all-have-a-nice-day. This was after my flight had been cancelled and I&rsquo;d had to exit to get a new ticket and return through security. I always get frisked when I go to the ticket counter and never when I check in online - I&rsquo;d like to know what kind of profiling system assumes terrorists don&rsquo;t use the Internet and a guy whose flight is rescheduled is a greater risk on the new flight. Well, maybe I see that last one.</p>

<p>The TSA at Will Rogers remind me of retail clerks not particularly happy with their jobs (while I can&rsquo;t imagine the TSA at LAX even qualifying for jobs at Walmart). On my recent return, the guy running the X-ray machine pushed all the luggage back, restarted the machine, and waited with a bored expression while I wondered whether he&rsquo;s waiting for me to push all the luggage back on. And then he stopped the conveyer belt when my Remington statue went through, and I thought oh, no, when they&rsquo;re through with it, I&rsquo;ll have a box of statue pieces to display. But instead, he picked up the box and said, &ldquo;it looks expensive, so I didn&rsquo;t want it going over the rollers.&rdquo; Hey, thanks! The spirit of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Will_Rogers">Will Rogers</a> lives!</p>
