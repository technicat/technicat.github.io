The Unity Penelope demo looks pretty good from its top-down vantage, so I thought I’d try it out as a [HyperBowl](http://hyperbowl3d.com/) lane, first as a [free app](https://itunes.apple.com/app/hyperbowl-penelope/id629387551) and then added to the [paid version](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/hyperbowl/id344209253). Turns out it looks pretty good from ground level, too, but I don’t know about the gameplay. In fact, I got it running last year and held off on releasing it because I didn’t think the gameplay was really working. There’s no clear path from the ball to the pins, so I put in some boost areas to launch ball in that general direction. But I figured recently, I put that much work into it, so why not, maybe some people will like it. And I was a little surprised to get some good reviews. So I guess I’ll keep it, although I’m still thinking maybe I should remove the center structure and see if it plays better that way
