<p>There are several contenders for worst app store administration, but I think I have to give the nod to the Nabi store. It was already in contention due to we-didn&rsquo;t-even-try elements such as screenshot sizes and aspect ratios that don&rsquo;t match the Nabi screens! But just now I tried to change my address, and they have it set up so that changing the address also requires changing your ID details. If you don&rsquo;t make any change, it complains you have to set a new password. If you switch to Password to set a new password it complains the email address is already taken. Meanwhile, my address is mistakenly set to Alabama.</p>
