Yesterday, I received one of my more interesting pieces of spam, an invitation from [The Center for Asia-Pacific Women in Politics](http://www.capwip.org/) to attend [The Third Global Congress of Women in Politics and Governance](http://www.capwip.org/3rdglobalcongress.htm).<!--more-->

It’s for “Parliamentarians, Decision-makers in National Governments; Environment Organizations / Agencies; Youth Leaders and Media Practitioners; Funding / Donor Agencies / Organizations”. I’m not sure where I fit in - maybe I’m a Media Practitioner.

This was sent to me via webmaster@technicat.com, an address that I’ve never used for official business, either taken off an old version of my web site or just conjured up as a likely address. It’s a nice break from porno spam, pyramid scam spam, refi spam, and help-me-launder-money spam, but I do get plenty of junk mail from non-profits. I’m a member of the [ACLU](http://www.aclu.org/) (a card-carrying member, but not a generous-donor member), but I’m not a fan of their opt-out mail list sharing policy. Hardly a progressive attitude on privacy.

One benefit of non-profits passing your name around like panhandlers sharing a mark is that from a few donations in years past, I now have a stockpile of complimentary address labels from a dozen agencies. Too bad many of them feature my name misspelled (Phillip instead of Philip). That’s my new criterion for writing a check - you get nothing if you can’t get my name right.
