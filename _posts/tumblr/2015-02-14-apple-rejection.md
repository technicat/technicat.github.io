“Apple and our customers place a high value on simple, refined, creative, well thought through interfaces. They take more work but are worth it. Apple sets a high bar. If your user interface is complex or less than very good, it may be rejected”

This is annoying because 1) it has that arrogant tone and 2) this rejection was for an app update. It’s already in the store and you won’t let me update it? This is why I don’t like making iOS-only apps.
