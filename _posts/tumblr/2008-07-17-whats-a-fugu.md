When I listed [Fugu Games](http://www.fugugames.com/) on the Dreamhost Site of the Month forum (garnering an average of 2 points out of 10), one reviewer asked :“What’s a Fugu?”. It seems to me it would have been faster to just type “fugu” in the browser search box, but a fugu is the poisonous Japanese puffer fish served as a delicacy. Some of you may recall the [Simpsons episode](http://www.videosift.com/video/The-Simpsons-Go-To-A-Sushi-Restaurant-Homer-eats-Fugu). See the [wikipedia article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fugu) for more information.

I came up with the name a few years ago after watching a segment on fugu on the [Food Network](http://www.foodnetwork.com/). Tasty, with a hint of danger - perfect name for a game company!
