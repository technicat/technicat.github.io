Some friends of mine were joking about the inanity of the Census letter alerting us to the upcoming Census letter. I’ve seen dumber - just off the top of my head, I recall the MIT student loan office sending me a letter saying they didn’t have my mailing address (and yet I got it), a half-hearted apology (quarter-hearted would be more accurate) from Healthnet saying they “lost” my check into another account and terminated my insurance because I wrote my name “illegably”…and then they addressed me as “Ralph”. And recently, there was the series of letters from the City of Huntington Beach emphasizing the public safety importance of maintaining consistent street address names, so they were going to rename my street and expect all the utility, mapping, government, postal and financial institutions to adjust their databases.

Nonetheless, I filled out and returned the census form when it arrived, because all these people on TV, like the mayor of LA and Ed Begley, JR., say it’s important to make sure resources go where they need to go. But they don’t really explain how that works, and in particular they don’t explain why they ask the questions they ask, many of which are legally forbidden in job interviews.

I especially am tired of answering the which-race-are-you question (and the really weirdly specific are-you-hispanic-and-which-kind). It reminds of my interrogations over the years - “Where are you from? No, before that. No, before that. I mean, where are you really from?”, “How long have you been in this country?” (I used to answer with my age, but then they just respond, “wow, that’s a really long time”, which is starting to make me feel old), and in Oregon recently I got a couple of “Welcome to America!"s.

And I don’t see the point. It’s not as if the census asks what languages I speak (or don’t speak) and will apportion language services accordingly to my area (although what Huntington Beach really needs are better Chinese restaurants, at least something without "Panda” or “Wok” in the name). Maybe they’re just making assumptions based on the race selection. Like that woman at the bottom of the MIT steps who saw me and walked all the way up to hand me an English-as-a-Second-Language flyer. Or the Boston locals who asked me if I spoke English (what am I supposed to say - “No. I don’t speak English”. But at least they asked).

I looked at the IGDA diversity survey recently and thought, while well-intentioned, it looked like it had been done by a college intern (I think it actually was). Now, I think that work is right up there with the professionals’. So, what happened to this “post-racial society” I heard of?
