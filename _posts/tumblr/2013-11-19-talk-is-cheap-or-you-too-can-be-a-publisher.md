When someone keeps asking for a phone call and doesn’t give you any details until the third email, you know it’s not going to be a good deal. So I wasn’t surprised to find out they wanted to publish one of my apps without giving me an advance.

> We typically don’t offer an advance on earnings, though we’ve been consistently able to improve our published partners’ revenue. We can’t guarantee revenue because much of it relies on the game itself, though we are confident in being able to secure 100,000 installs in just a few weeks. With this boost, a game of HyperBowl’s quality should be able to monetize quite effectively

That sounds like a great business model. Hey, all you developers out there, I’ll be happy to publish your app, as long as I get a cut of the revenue and don’t have to put any money down. I sort-of-not-really promise you’ll make money!
