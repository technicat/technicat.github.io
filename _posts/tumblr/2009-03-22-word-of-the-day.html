<p>Lately, I haven&rsquo;t been sure that &ldquo;bonus&rdquo; meant what I thought it meant, so I checked the definition on <a href="http://yourdictationary.com/">YourDictionary.com</a>:

anything given in addition to the customary or required amount; specif.,
</p><ol><li>payment over and above salary given to an employee as an incentive or reward</li>
	<li>a government payment to military veterans</li>
	<li>BRIT. a dividend to insurance policyholders; also, an extra dividend to stockholders</li>
</ol>
And they also have  a &ldquo;legal&rdquo; definition:
	<li>Wages paid in addition to the compensation ordinarily given or required under an employment contract. A bonus is payment for services (such as for recognition of exceptional work performance) or on consideration, and is neither gift nor gratuity.</li>
	<li>Anything given or provided for free in addition to what is usual, agreed to, or legally due.</li>
