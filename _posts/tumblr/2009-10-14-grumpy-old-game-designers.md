Chris Crawford is probably the most famous, or infamous, carmudgeon in game design. Years after founding the Computer Game Developers Conference, he ended his participation by screaming at an imaginary dragon and running toward the lecture hall exit while waving a sword. After leading games research at Atari in the early eighties, he has since then worked independently, eschewing big-budget game productions to work on his own interactive storytelling technology.

So I half-expected **Chris Crawford on Game Design** to consist of grumblings about the dreadful state of the modern video game industry. Chapters like “Random Sour Observations” and “Old Fart Stories” do bring that flavor to this book, but other chapters on “Play”, “Challenge”, “Conflict” and “Interactivity” bring a welcome intellectual analysis to defining what makes a good game. How many game designers know that the word “fun” has no equivalent in other languages? On the other hand, Crawford uses the German word “Schwerpunkt” in pinpointing interactivity as the essense of computer gaming.

The chapters detailing the intricacies of Crawford’s games contribute heavily to the 476 page length of this book - but the reader with a short attention span (a typical problem with the average gamer and game designer, by the way) can digest the nearly one hundred lessons interspersed on side panels. They range from the bitter-sounding, “96 - Money can ruin a noble cause”, to the instructive, “31 - Begin each project with a one-page specification of the gameplay”, to the cautionary, “65 - Limit yourself to one major innovation per game”.

And my favorite, “23 - Don’t get a job in the games industry unless you really, really love games.” Clearly, after more than twenty years in the business, Crawford still loves games, and it shows in this unique thinking man’s book on game design.
