<p>I started adding moving streetcars to the <a href="http://hyperbowl3d.com/">HyperBowl</a> San Francisco lane, laying out <a href="http://itween.pixelplacement.com/">iTween</a> paths. Although I have some adequate car turning behavior in the Tokyo lane, you can see I don&rsquo;t have it quite right here, somehow.</p>
