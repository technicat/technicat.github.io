<p>Through the magic of Facebook I&rsquo;ve reconnected with some of my classmates from Iowa City West High School (which I&rsquo;ve noticed is convenient name, as I found some document frames at Staples already containing a &ldquo;West High School&rdquo; diploma). I&rsquo;ve found it interesting to see many are still attached to the city and have stayed there or returned there. I guess I wasn&rsquo;t really there long enough to bond with the place - just my high school years - so when I returned for my 10th year high school reunion I hardly recognized the area.</p>

<p>But living in the LA area has accentuated some fond Iowa memories. For one thing, I remember in downtown Iowa City, cars would always stop for pedestrians crossing the street, wherever they happened to cross. So it&rsquo;s a miracle that I didn&rsquo;t end up on a windshield when I went to Boston for college (that actually happens to a few freshmen every year). And once while I trudged to school, a driver stopped and offered me a ride. Which I took. Around here, that would result in an Amber Alert.</p>

<p>Of course, it&rsquo;s been a while, and things may have changed. But I suspect not a lot. When I drove back there for my tenth year reunion, I stayed overnight at a hotel by a truck stop cafe, and when I ordered breakfast my brain misfired and I requested hash browns instead of what I meant, corned beef hash. The waitress asked &ldquo;Just hash browns?&rdquo;, and when I confirmed, returned with a heaping plate of hash browns, enough for more than a meal. And the check listed $.99. Maybe the waitress figured I was an impoverished foreign student. Anyway, best plate of hash browns I ever had.</p>
