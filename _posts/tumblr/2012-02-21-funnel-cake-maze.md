During some recent testing of the photo feature on the Android version of [Fugu Maze](https://market.android.com/details?id=com.technicat.FuguMaze) (I updated it to Unity 3.5 and the latest version of the prime31 Etcetera plugin, still working out the glitches), I chose a picture of one of [Habibi’s funnel cakes](http://www.yelp.com/biz/habibis-funnel-cake-tustin). It’s the same pic I used for my foursquare update. Which reminds me, I’d like to do something that integrates with the foursquare API…
