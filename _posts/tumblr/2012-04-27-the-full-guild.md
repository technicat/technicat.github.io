When I first tried to watch The Guild, I couldn’t get into it. I just don’t like watching videos on a computer screen. Later, I watched it on XBox Live and I was hooked, but the segments are so short I felt like I was selecting videos and hitting Play all the time. Recently, I tried again, watching full seasons at a time from YouTube on my iPad 3 - I think that’s the optimal viewing experience (maybe because the iPad 3 cost at least two XBox’s).
