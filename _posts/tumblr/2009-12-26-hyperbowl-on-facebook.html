<p>Personally, I avoid Facebook apps since they usually have obnoxious or deceptive ads, and I don&rsquo;t really trust the apps, either. But from what I&rsquo;ve read and all the Mafia Wars wall posts of my Facebook friends, it&rsquo;s a game platform that shouldn&rsquo;t be ignored. Conveniently, dimerocker started a closed beta of their platform supporting Facebook Unity games, which saves me a whole bunch of work setting up my own server-side infrastructure and figuring out how to make money on it (i.e. getting ads). I tried it out Christmas Eve and in less than two hours got HyperBowl up and running as a <a href="http://apps.facebook.com/hyperbowl">Facebook app</a>. It looks promising - if all goes well, I&rsquo;ll add more lanes and use the dimerocker API for leaderboards and such.</p>
