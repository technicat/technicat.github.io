<p>I seem to end up in a lot of conversations that unexpectedly turn to Barack Obama. Just this past week, a conversation about real estate turned into &ldquo;You know, Obama&rsquo;s a Muslim.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Normally, I try to just sidle away at this point, but she explained &ldquo;His father&rsquo;s a Muslim, and Muslims consider Obama a Muslim.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thus, I felt obligated to inform her that, by that reasoning, I&rsquo;m a Muslim, too, since I&rsquo;m descended from Muslims on my father&rsquo;s side.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you&rsquo;re not a terrorist, right?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Now, first of all, I&rsquo;m not a Muslim. And, no, I&rsquo;m not a terrorist (first time I&rsquo;ve been asked that, but I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;ll be on the TSA questionnaire one of these days). Anyway, who cares who&rsquo;s a Muslim? And wait, did you just say Obama&rsquo;s a terrorist? Also, if you think someone&rsquo;s a Muslim because Muslims think he&rsquo;s a Muslim, doesn&rsquo;t that make you a Muslim? This is what happens when you follow a train wreck of thought.</p>

<p>But good news, people. to my surprise, I may be a Muslim, but (not to my surprise) I&rsquo;m not a terrorist. And now, back to our regular programming.</p>
