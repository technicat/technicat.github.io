When my Samsung Vibrant failed recently, transmitting my voice successfully but only returning static from the other end, I was almost glad - it’s an excuse to switch to Verizon and get an iPhone. But when I brought my phone to the T-Mobile store, they verified the problem and said they’d just ship me a new one under warranty, and, no muss, no fuss, I got a box at my doorstep two days later, switched my battery and sim card into the new one, and popped the old one into the box for return. I guess I was surprised, because my trial purchase of an AT&T mobile broadband modem turned into a very expensive trial (“we don’t prorate”, explained the customer service rep as they charged me for the remainder of the month) This is why I’ve stayed with T-Mobile the last eight years, the customer service (although I haven’t tried to cancel a contract - I hear that can get expensive)

In contrast, there’s Time Warner. Their store and installation reps are fine - I don’t like the door-to-door salesmen who throw random pricing packages at me like used car salesmen or the telemarketers who’ve been calling me the last three years despite my repeated requests to take me off their calling list. And by the way, calling me at 8:30 last night while I’m watching TV to sell me their TV service - really annoying. Apparently, it really bugs them that I only have their cable internet and not their cable TV. Well, I only got their internet service because I had a contract developing with CryEngine 2, and at the time, a laptop just couldn’t cut it, but now I’m all laptop again and I can just do my Internet work at Starbucks (I did that for a few years before the CryEngine project, and it’s a pretty nice work day, tapping away at the keyboard while sipping tea at a coffee shop near the beach…). So I guess TW did me a favor - time to cancel them and put that $60/month into lattes.
