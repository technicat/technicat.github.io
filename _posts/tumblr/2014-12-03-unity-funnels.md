I spent a little time trying out custom events and funnels in Unity Analytics. As I understand it, the idea is to track how many users progress through sequences of achievements and in-app purchase points. I donâ€™t think I really have HyperBowl set up for that, but I defined a score event that is submitted at the end of the game and set up a funnel which I think tells me how many people play consecutive games, up to four games in a row.
