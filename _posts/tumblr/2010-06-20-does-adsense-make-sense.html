<p>I&rsquo;m using a $100 promotional Google Adsense credit to advertise HyperBowl (at $2/day). It seems to be working, to the extent that searching for &ldquo;hyperbowl&rdquo; brings up the ad above all the results. (although on my iPad, the ad shows up on the right).</p>

<p>But my HyperBowl site, which is the site that the ad links to, shows up as the top search result, anyway. So I&rsquo;m not sure what I just accomplished, except to give the impression that I have an advertising strategy (and budget).</p>
