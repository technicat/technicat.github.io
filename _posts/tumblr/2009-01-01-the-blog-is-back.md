Well, I guess I’ll keep this blog going. It’s a convenient feed into [Facebook](http://facebook.com/) (as far as I can tell, I can only import one blog into Facebook without using an additional app), and I still want to post my [WordsEye](http://wordseye.com/) “art”, like this latest one:

Also, I feel kind of lazy after I stopped blogging - like the way I stopped using my Wii Fit (I just don’t want to see the on-screen nagging about why I gained a couple of pounds).

I’ve got comments turned off now (at least I think I do - I still have spam streaming in for previous posts), which seems to diminish the blogness of this blog, but I figure any post that gets really popular will garner plenty of civil and uncivil discourse on [digg](http://digg.com/) or [reddit](http://reddit.com/), like this [argument on design patterns](http://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/6uex6/design_patterns_are_in_purgatory), and some people respond to blogs on their own blogs, like [this post that said I got it totally wrong](http://kawagner.blogspot.com/). That’s fine - rebuttal posts like that probably took more effort than I spent on my own, and certainly more time than it takes just to post a comment (some are fun to read, and some looked like they were sneezed out by someone having a bad day)

I do regret accidentally deleting a comment on my post regarding the recent game credits controversy. But not enough to try rolling back the database. So I’ll just recap the point made by a well-known game designer, that game development involves a lot more types of talent than general software development and game developers rely on game credits to stay in the industry and further their careers. That’s a valid point, and, although the issue of formal crediting can get pretty complicated, as in the film industry, I think it’d be pretty cool to have a database like [MobyGames](http://mobygames.com/), but for software in general. If you worked on, say, MacOSX, wouldn’t you like to point to your name, along with several hundred others, and brag, “see, I worked on that”.( On the other hand, if you worked on Vista, you might not be so eager)
