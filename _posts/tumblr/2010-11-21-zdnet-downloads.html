<p>Much as I like to see my apps listed on as many web sites as possible (well, not the piracy sites), I&rsquo;m not impressed by the ZDNet site. The screenshot is squashed, the text grabbed right off the iTunes page has lost formatting, the category description is vaguely &ldquo;mobile&rdquo; and also confusingly mentions &ldquo;other PC games&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Worst, you have to register just to click on the link to the real download site which they&rsquo;re not even hosting, and in doing so, you get spam.</p>
