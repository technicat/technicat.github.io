I’ve seen a couple of recent complaints that the black-and-white [HyperBowl](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/hyperbowl/id344209253) icon is too bland. I thought the toucharcade forum member was overly dramatic (“get rid of that hideous monstrosity”) and I’m skeptical that it was the only thing preventing his purchase. But I though the HowsMyApp review had a good point that there should be differentiation between the full HyperBowl game and the individual lanes also on the App Store. So I dug this new one out of the archives, which has some color.
