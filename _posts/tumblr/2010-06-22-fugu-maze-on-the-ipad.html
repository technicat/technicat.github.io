<p>I finally got around to updating <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/app/fugu-maze/id295808255?mt=8">Fugu Maze</a> for the iPad. At the iPad full screen resolution, I think it looks pretty good, and it&rsquo;s faster than the iPhone version (although I had to turn off fog). I was concerned the two-thumb control might not translate, but seems to me it still works. The shake-to-scramble feature is more of a workout on the iPad, though.</p>
