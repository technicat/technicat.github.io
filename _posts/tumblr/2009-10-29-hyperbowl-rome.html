<p>After two weeks in submission, <a href="http://itunes.com/app/hyperbowlrome">HyperBowl Rome</a>, the second <a href="http://hyperbowl3d.com/">HyperBowl</a> lane, is now on the App Store.</p>

<p>For performance reasons, I removed a lot of the transparent/translucent objects but added some particle fire effects not available in the originalgame.</p>
