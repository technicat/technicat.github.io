<p>I was performing my morning Wii Fit workout, playing the cycling game, when I realized the game goal, finding the shortest route to collect all the flags, was the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem">Traveling Salesman Problem</a>. The TSP is the most famous <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_NP-complete_problems">NP-Complete problem</a> and was kind of fashionable back around the time I graduated from college. You could easily find the book by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computers_and_Intractability:_A_Guide_to_the_Theory_of_NP-Completeness">Garey and Johnson</a>, and there was even a sly reference to the fundamental question P=NP in a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treehouse_of_Horror_VI">Simpsons </a>and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futurama">Futurama</a> episodes.</p>

<p>I recall at my first job, working on automated VLSI design software, one of my coworkers often exclaimed upon seeing any non-trivial problem was to exclaim &ldquo;that&rsquo;s the traveling salesman problem!&rdquo; That, of course, was silly, but it&rsquo;s silliness with ambition (if you solve the question whether P=NP, you&rsquo;ve got a lock on the Turing Award) These days, instead of computational complexity and algorithms, I hear about design patterns instead - &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a singleton! That&rsquo;s a factory pattern!&rdquo; More correct, but less interesting. I miss the TSP.</p>
