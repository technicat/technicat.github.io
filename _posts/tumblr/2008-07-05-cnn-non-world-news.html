<p>It was old news by then, but late last evening I caught a CNN &ldquo;breaking news&rdquo; interruption announcing the video footage of the Colombian hostage rescue operation. Basically, three sentences:
</p><ol><li>Three American hostages rescued.</li>
	<li>That is, three American hostages, plus the Colombian-French citizen Ingrid Betancourt</li>
	<li>News at 11</li>
</ol>
No mention of the eleven other hostages, some of who&rsquo;ve been held in captivity ten years. The <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/americas/07/05/farc.americans/index.html">CNN web site</a> isn&rsquo;t much better - in a full page of stories, only one line mentions that there were other hostages - you have to click on a link leading to &ldquo;world news&rdquo; to read about the others. Nice bit of catering to American self-absorption on the Fourth of July. This is why I watch the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/">BBC</a> news on <a href="http://www.pbs.org/">PBS</a>.
