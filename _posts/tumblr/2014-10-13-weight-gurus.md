When I left New Jersey, I left behind the $200 “smart” scale I got from the Apple Store. Now I live near a Bed Bath and Beyond which stocks a much cheaper ($50) scale from Weight Gurus that also uploads data that is synced to an Android or iOS app. The app is not quite as good as the other one - the UI is a bit clunkier and I can’t figure out how to refresh the data without restarting the app. And the scale doesn’t feature some of the bizarre readings the other one did, like room temperature, or automatically upload data to your account and devices.

But the syncing is clever - as the readings display, start the app and aim the camera at the scale to read a barcode. That is a big awkward as you have to remember to take your phone when you weigh yourself, but it’s one of those inconveniently cool things.
