I can’t tell if this is a sales pitch or a threat. It’s definitely spam (I’m not on Yelp). But if you have any questions, feel free to contact alec@revleap.com.

> Given your current ranking I thought you may like to know that research from Harvard Business shows that each star increase on Yelp impacts your profit between 5-9%, and 78 percent of Americans agree that online reviews influence their purchasing decisions. Revleap.com is offering a software that allows you to filter your negative reviews before they post to Yelp, while simultaneously pushing your positive reviews through. Please see attached PDF for details. We sell the software to only 1 company per industry in each region to ensure that whoever uses it becomes the #1 rated business in their marketplace. This offer expires in 72 hours, at which time I will offer this opportunity to another business in your community for their exclusive use.
