I’ve been using Mogl for a few weeks now, and really, just the cashback feature seems to make it worthwhile. The number of participating restaurants in my area was small, but seems to be growing. I also really like the meal donation aspect.

However, I turned off email notifications because I didn’t really care about how I just lost the number one spot at a nearby restaurant. It actually matters, since there is a cash reward, but still, don’t want to hear it. And I was exasperated to find Mogl posts on my Facebook wall for each of my dining events, so I turned that off, too (it didn’t help that each post started off with “Boom!”).

So here’s an example where “gamification” and social networking detracts from the appealing features - good old-fashioned cashback and donations.
