I’m a sucker for graphs, including site popularity graphs. Here’s a graph of visits to my web sites from the [Compete Site Analytics](http://siteanalytics.compete.com/) page:

The[technicat](http://technicat.com/) site has been pretty steady the last few years, but my [personal site](http://philipchu.com/) didn’t even register. This blog has only been around half a year, but looks like it also might have flatlined except for a late spike, probably due to one day of 4000 hits from [reddit](http://reddit.com/), during yet another thread on design patterns.

Lest I indulge solely in web site narcissism, here’s a chart comparing three other sites, [Koo’s Corner](http://benkoo.com/), [Bike Mecca](http://bikemecca.com/), and [WordsEye](http://wordseye.com/).
