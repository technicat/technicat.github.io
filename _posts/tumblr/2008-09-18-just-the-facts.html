<p>While the news anchors and pundits (like Wolf Blitzer in his Situation Room and &ldquo;the best political team in television&rdquo;) revel in the presidential campaign, I find it depressing to hear the candidates stoop to he-said-she-said level of repartee (which reminds me of my high-school debate team classmates who practiced talking fast so they could win by spouting more points than their opponents). And disingenously taking each other&rsquo;s remarks out of context reflects poorly on their honesty or their intelligence. Or ours. Next time you listen to one of their speeches or the sensationalistic or partisan spin on the cable channels, do your own <a href="http://www.factcheck.org/">Fact Check</a>.</p>
