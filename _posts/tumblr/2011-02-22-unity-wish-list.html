<p>Christmas is past, but anyway, here&rsquo;s my Unity wish list (by the way, I&rsquo;ve spent $4000 on Unity licenses, so everyone complaining about how their Indie licenses don&rsquo;t include Pro features, get back in line).
</p><ul><li>Less reliance on FBX. I know it has to be supported, but relying on the FBX SDK to handle OBJ and Collada imports (never see that officially confirmed, but I think that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s happening) is asking for trouble.</li>
	<li>Remove that default .01 scaling factor on FBX imports, or at least allow setting a new default. Importing generally works pretty well, but the automatic import is pretty useless if I have to manually adjust and reimport everything. And it really messed me up when I didn&rsquo;t realize the default scaling factor was not 1 - I ended up blaming artists (more enjoyable when I&rsquo;m right) and scaling the physics system (doesn&rsquo;t scale well by two orders of magnitude).</li>
	<li>Per-platform audio import settings. Just like the per-platform overrides on texture imports. I definitely want to compress all audio on my web players, but not necessarily on desktop or iOS builds.</li>
	<li>Player settings to customize the About box on desktop builds.</li>
	<li>Player settings that fill out the required info.plist entries for Mac App Store builds (life is too short to spend filling out info.plist files)</li>
	<li>A checkbox on iOS builds for UIApplicationQuitsOnSuspend. Not really that important, but there are some apps where I feel it makes more sense for them to restart when you exit and resume.</li>
	<li>Create game objects underneath a selected object. At least half the time, when I create a game object I want it somewhere within a hierarchy, and it&rsquo;s a hassle to create, find and drag it back to the desired spot, especially in complex scenes.</li>
	<li>Application.OpenURL should have a target parameter like the Flash equivalent. In web players, I almost never want to clobber the current page with the new one.</li>
	<li>A UNITY_PRO compiler define so scripts can be shared among Pro and Indie.</li>
	<li>Fix the forums! I can&rsquo;t unsubscribe from threads, and I often miss emails from those threads that I do want to remain subscribed to.</li>
	<li>Remove the feature request feature from the bug reporter, or link it to the feedback site. Unity seems to want everyone to use the <a href="http://feedback.unity3d.com/">feedback site</a> instead, but as long as it&rsquo;s there, it&rsquo;s not clear whether we&rsquo;re supposed to submit feature requests to one or both.</li>
	<li>More allowed votes on the feedback site. Only ten are allotted, which means you can only submit ten feature requests, and if you do, then you can&rsquo;t vote up anyone other requests. You can easily get around that by creating multiple logins (I accidentally created a second one when I forgot about my firstÂ  one, which I&rsquo;d stopped using because I ran out of votes), but then, that just seems silly.</li>
	<li>Oh, almost forgot this one - scale down the Magic Mouse Input.GetAxis values. It really messes up <a href="http://hyperbowl3d.com/">HyperBowl</a> and you can notice it makes Unity mouse-look (including first person controllers) way too twitchy.</li>
</ul>
