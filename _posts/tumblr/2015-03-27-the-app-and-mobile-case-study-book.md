[![The App & Mobile Case Study Book](https://d.gr-assets.com/books/1328698369m/12959963.jpg)](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12959963-the-app-mobile-case-study-book)[The App & Mobile Case Study Book](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12959963-the-app-mobile-case-study-book) by [Rob Ford](https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/198651.Rob_Ford)  
My rating: [3 of 5 stars](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/928170094)  
  
It’s a interesting list of apps, but all the “case studies” are written by the app developers or publishers or ad agencies, so some of them read more like press releases than postmortems.
