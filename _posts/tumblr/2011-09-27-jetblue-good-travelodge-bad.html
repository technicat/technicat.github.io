<p>I am constantly impressed how the Internet has made much of daily life so convenient. This past Saturday afternoon, I booked a flight to San Francisco and a corresponding hotel stay so I could attend a family get-together on Sunday. Then I ruined the execution of that plan by driving to the airport without my wallet (Google Wallet is starting to sound good now!).

JetBlue was cool - they rebooked my flight without charge for the next morning. My experience trying to cancel my Travelodge reservation, however, just showed that the web can be an efficient way to deploy bad customer experience. First, I saw the email confirmation said to go to the reservation web page to cancel. But clicking on that link just brought up a page saying the reservation was confirmed, and listing the cancellation deadline. So, back to the email, and I called the property directly, whereupon the person on the line told me there was a 24-hour cancellation &ldquo;window&rdquo; so I was out the full $170. I was pretty sure I&rsquo;d seen 4pm listed as the deadline, so I checked the email, and yup, it listed 4pm&hellip;of the previous day.

Now, obviously, I should have read it more closely, but really, I didn&rsquo;t expect it to say, effectively &ldquo;if you need to cancel, you must cancel by yesterday&rdquo;, although that wording would have been more clear. Or, as the person on the phone told me, there&rsquo;s a &ldquo;24 hour&rdquo; cancellation period. If I&rsquo;d known that it was a non-cancellable reservation, I certainly wouldn&rsquo;t have made it.

Another practice that the web has made more convenient is venting dissatisfaction, so I went to the Travelodge web site to complain. But even that part of their web experience is a mess (they apparently went to the Travelodge equivalent of a web design firm). There are multiple links to contact pages, one of which is labelled reservations/cancellations. Yet that page instructs you to select a topic, without any mechanism to do so, and just below that states what the topic is (reservations and cancellations), and the feedback for requires you to fill in twelve fields of info that you already had to fill in for your reservation, but not including the confirmation number which would obviate all that. It&rsquo;s like that last time I tried to fill in a form for a government job application (I gave up after filling in the same information three times).

At this point, I didn&rsquo;t even bother to ask for a refund, I just complained that they had a lousy web site and that I never would have made the reservation if they&rsquo;d stated more directly that the reservation was not cancellable, and suggested they make some improvements. To my surprise, I got a call today from one of their customer service reps, but if their web site could talk, it would sound like her:
</p><blockquote>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re sorry, we cannot give you a refund because the reservation clearly lists the cancellation policy&rdquo;

&ldquo;It didn&rsquo;t mention a policy, it just listed a time and date. The person at the property said there&rsquo;s a 24 hour cancellation window. That&rsquo;s a policy.&rdquo;

&ldquo;Sir, the reservation listed the cancellation policy.&rdquo;

&ldquo;What exactly did the reservation list?&rdquo;

&ldquo;It lists the cancellation date and time&rdquo;</blockquote>
It went on like that. I said if I&rsquo;d known the reservation was not cancellable, I would not have made it. She responded that the reservation was cancellable, just not at the time I&rsquo;d made it. At this point, I was turning into one of those annoying people who you see yelling into their cell phone in public. I said, look, I&rsquo;m not expecting a refund, I&rsquo;m just trying to tell you there are problems with your web site and not just the reservation and cancellation part, but even the customer feedback pages, like this part and that, did you read what I said in the feedback form? And then I think I broke her - she just started saying, &ldquo;we cannot give you a refund&hellip;we cannot give you a refund&rdquo; Now I&rsquo;m wondering she was a customer service chatbot, programmed to annoy.
