<p>On a recent trip to Bend, OR, one of my credit card numbers was stolen (heavy usage took place shortly after I arrived, so the theft probably took place either at the restaurant or smoothie place I went to that day). The credit card company detected the suspect purchases immediately and changed my account after confirming with me. One inconvenient side effect is now I seem to be locked out of the <a href="http://www.annualcreditreport.com/">free credit reports</a> mandated by law (not the &ldquo;free&rdquo; one that comes with non-free frills pushed by the singing waiter on TV). On the other hand, when an ISP that I no longer use (<a href="http://domain.com/">domain.com</a> via <a href="http://registernames.com/">registernames.com</a>) attempted to automatically renew my account for another year without informing me beforehand, they were unable to charge me (they did send me an email about that, asking me to update my account with a new credit card. Yeah, right)</p>

<p>Too bad I didn&rsquo;t use the same card for the .mac account I purchased last year. Recently, I received an email from Apple thanking me for renewing my <a href="http://www.apple.com/mobileme/">MobileMe</a> account. That&rsquo;s pretty strange wording, considering MobileMe is new, but apparently all .mac accounts have been converted over. I didn&rsquo;t receive any additional email about getting charged for it, but a few weeks later I did see a charge on my credit card bill from the Apple Online Store.</p>

<p>First, I tried to resolve this the tech-savvy way by going to the Mobile Me support page (I didn&rsquo;t see a link on the MobileMe login page but there was one on my renewal email). The article on cancellation said to log in and select the Cancel Account option in the Billing page, and if this took place within 45 days of the charge, it would be refunded. Whew! Except I haven&rsquo;t been using my .Mac account so I didn&rsquo;t remember my ID. So I called the Apple Online Store number listed on my credit card transaction, and that got me not much besides an earful of static-y hold music, but the friendly rep was able to find my login ID, so I was able to go through the Forgot Password-&gt;Reset Password routine on the login page and finally get into my .mac-now-mobileme account. Whereupon I found that Apple had sent me notice that they were billing me for renewal, but they&rsquo;d only sent that info to my .Mac email. And there was no Cancel Account option, so back to the support page where the only other option was the Support Chat feature. Click - &ldquo;A support agent will be with you in 3 minutes&hellip;10 minutes&hellip;2 minutes&hellip;&rdquo; It&rsquo;s like watching a Windows progress bar.</p>

<p>But once an agent showed up, he (or she?) processed my cancellation and refund request quickly, after asking if I needed to back up anything first, and said the refund would show up in five billing days (we&rsquo;ll see). And after closing the chat window, a brief customer satisfaction survey popped up, along with an option to receive a transcript of the session. So I&rsquo;d have to say the vaunted Apple experience came through in the last few minutes of the process. The automatic renewal charge and sending selected emails to an account that I just might be checking are practices I could do without. It would have been much simpler if someone had just stolen my credit card.</p>
