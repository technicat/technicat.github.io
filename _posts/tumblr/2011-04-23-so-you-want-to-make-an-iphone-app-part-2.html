<p>Some time ago, I wrote I blogged about <a href="http://www.fugutalk.com/?p=3925">what you should figure out before looking to contract iPhone development</a>. That was mostly on the business end, and I&rsquo;m still talking to a lot of people who have an idea for an iPhone app (four people at just one recent dinner!), so here I&rsquo;ll follow up on that with some more design-oriented advice. If you&rsquo;re doing everything yourself and just treating this as a learning experience or expensive hobby, you can do things your own way, but if you&rsquo;re spending your own money and collaborating with others, you need to be efficient and methodical. I actually operate in both modes - I experiment and throw stuff out there and am pleasantly surprised when something seems to stick, but I try to be careful on bigger projects, especially something like <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/hyperbowl/id344209253?mt=8">HyperBowl</a>, which involves licensing assets and a brand from the original developer.</p>

<p>First of all, decide on your target platforms. iPhone, iPad, iPod touch? Some or all? Which versions? If your design requires a camera, that leaves out 1st-gen iPads and pre 4th-gen iPod touches. If you support less than 4th-gen devices, that means non-Retina displays. iPhone and iPad have different resolutions and aspect ratios, of course. You can deliver one &ldquo;universal&rdquo; build that supports both, but many developers have elected to publish separate &ldquo;HD&rdquo; versions for the iPad so they can charge more (but now with the Retina displays, everything is more or less HD).</p>

<p>Get your target platform. You need to sit down (or carry around) and use the device like the target customers, download tons of apps, especially those similar to the ones you&rsquo;re contemplating, get a feel for the device. If I didn&rsquo;t have an iOS device, I might not know that iOS apps don&rsquo;t have Quit buttons - apps are always exited by the hardware button. On the other hand, with the advent of iOS 4.0 and multitasking, the hardware quit button sometimes suspends, so if you allow that, you might need to add a Quit button that goes back to the beginning of your app.</p>

<p>Another reason to get a device is to research apps, especially those similar to what you have in mind, see what the customers are saying in the App Store reviews, see how the apps are marketed (tweets, Facebook pages, user forums, promotions&hellip;), check app credits to see how many people worked on it, and so on. With several hundred thousand apps on the store, there&rsquo;s probably at least a few similar to what you have in mind. I&rsquo;m not saying to let that dissuade you, but it would be silly not to look at them and figure out what you can do better or differently, what seems to work and what doesn&rsquo;t (I now have a firm opinion on what tilt controls are good for and not) and if no one has a feature that you have in mind, maybe there&rsquo;s a reason (technical limitation, Apple restriction, lot of research and hard work&hellip;.)</p>

<p>Acquaint yourself with the <a href="http://developer.apple.com/appstore/resources/approval/guidelines.html">App Store Review Guidelines</a>. Apple can reject your app for those reasons, or really, anytime they feel like it. Browse the internet for blogs by peeved developers (including me).</p>

<p>Understand what design is. It&rsquo;s not an idea. Ideas are worthless - I&rsquo;ve already got a whole bunch that I don&rsquo;t have time to get to, and until then, they&rsquo;re no more valuable than my ideas for that screenplay or novel, or what I&rsquo;m going to have for dinner. Design isn&rsquo;t a few screen mockups or a storyboard either. That may be a design for a comic book, but not an app. For an app, you should be able to sketch out a state diagram - the transitions among all the screens and the states within, and the conditions that trigger them (when this button is pushed&hellip;) If you can&rsquo;t list the various program states and draw the transitions amonth them, then you don&rsquo;t have a design. This isn&rsquo;t just nitpicking - coding an app is actually implementing the state machine, and if you leave it up to the programmer to figure out, then the programmer is actually the designer. For my own apps, before coding anything with moderate complexity, I have to sketch out the state diagram.</p>

<p>Start small. Don&rsquo;t be the Duke Nukem of iPhone apps. That doesn&rsquo;t mean you can&rsquo;t have a grand vision, but you can deliver it in stages - that&rsquo;s a big advantage of the App Store. You can update anytime you want (given Apple approval). In fact, it&rsquo;s encouraged by Apple, and customers get antsy if they don&rsquo;t see regular updates. And some features get more feasible over time. When I released the first HyperBowl lane on the 2nd-gen iPhones and iPod touches, it barely ran. Now it runs twice as fast (mostly due to the improved Unity game engine performance, not my own programming), more content is available on the newer iOS hardware, and the availability of more Unity plugins and iOS features like Game Center makes adding features a continous catch-up game. I agree with <a href="http://gamesfromwithin.com/all-it-needs-is-love">Noel Llopis&rsquo;s blog on this</a>, deliver something not necessarily complete, but polished, and keep adding to it.</p>

<p>Account for all the assets. Where are you getting the art? The sound? Fonts? Do you need to buy more software licenses? Make sure you&rsquo;re not violating any licenses or just stealing. That&rsquo;s one reason, besides good manners, that I try to credit all the asset and software providers in the app and/or in the App Store description - I want to have it on record where everything came from. This is pretty important if you ever end up handing the app over to another publisher or even buyer.</p>

<p>I highly encourage prototyping. I use the Unity game engine, so if you make a web player in that, you&rsquo;re halfway there. Even mocking it up in Flash would help - there&rsquo;s nothing like a working prototype to help you flesh out all those little details you haven&rsquo;t considered and to get a real feel for your concept. If you make a web version, you can try it out on the public - I put many of my apps as web players on <a href="http://gamejolt.com/">GameJolt</a> and <a href="http://kongregate.com/">Kongregate</a>.</p>

<p>Which brings me to middleware. Do you know which middleware you want to use, if any? If you code your app entirely inÂ  Objective-C, you have a decent chance of porting it to a Mac version, but not anything else. And you still might end up requiring some middleware (e.g. a lot of 2D games use Cocos2D for rendering and Chipmunk for physics). I use Unity because I like 3D and the ability to make desktop/web/Android versions of my apps. A lot of it comes down to preference and experience and should determine who you choose to work with - if you work with me, I&rsquo;ll probably try to think of a reason to use Unity (or steer you to a project that can be implemented with Unity) because I&rsquo;ve spent most of my time working with that and it&rsquo;ll take me a while to figure out other frameworks. If you&rsquo;re paying me to do that (as is the case with my regular contract work), that&rsquo;s fine with me, it&rsquo;s your dime, but if we&rsquo;re trying to get from Point A to Point B as efficiently as possible, then to a hammer, everything looks like a nail&hellip;</p>

<p>Have a schedule. I don&rsquo;t mean a week-to-week schedule, I hate those things. It&rsquo;s easy to spend all your time writing up task lists and not getting anything done. I mean, make your expectations clear - do you need this published by the holiday season? Were you thinking it would take just a couple of months? Are you waiting on anything - assets, an iOS update, the next iPhone, new middleware, funding?</p>

<p>And remember it can take a while to get Apple approval, even for updates. I&rsquo;ve had apps approved in a few days and apps that took two months just to hear that it was rejected. Which reminds me, you should probably plan for rejection and resubmission.</p>

<p>How do you plan to price the app? (this is where that comparable app research comes in again) Are you planning a &ldquo;lite&rdquo; version? Or ad support? If you&rsquo;re incorporating ads, you have to choose the ad vendor (I use Apple&rsquo;s iAds, many use third-parties like AdMobs), and design for it. Most of my apps don&rsquo;t have space either top or bottom banner ads. The latest iOS release supports full-page iAds, which I&rsquo;m thinking about adding as transitions between scenes, but that will take some thought and probably experimentation on where would be the least annoying vs. most revenue-regenerating.</p>

<p>What&rsquo;s your plan for updates? Just get the first release out and forget about it? Update as needed? (iOS 3.0 broke all my apps and I had to update all of them) Or do you have a long list of features you plan to add over time? Are you going to contract or partner with the same people for all of them or hire/find people as needed?</p>

<p>Think about how you want to market the app. Set up a Facebook page, twitter account, look for an external publisher, send promo codes to which sites, make YouTube videos, issue press releases, or just hire someone&hellip;</p>

<p>Finally, be clear about the collaboration (unlike all those Unity forum posts &ldquo;come work on my MMO for free!&rdquo;). Who is responsible for what, who owns what in the end, and who owes what. If someone is getting paid on a work-for-hire basis, it&rsquo;s a lot more clear, but otherwise you&rsquo;re asking for trouble if you suddenly have a hit and everyone thinks they own 50% or more of the pie or profits. My stand is, if we collaborate on an app and no money is changing hands, and I code and publish it (and provide all the middleware along the way), I own the app but you retain the ownership of any assets you brought to the table (I&rsquo;m in favor of making this clear on a credits screen), and we can talk about how to handle the brand and deployment on other platforms (this is another reason you should prototype as much as you can on your own, if you want to be able to lay claim on it) - this is similar to the licensing arrangement I have for HyperBowl - I licensed their assets and brand from their existing game so I can deploy a new version on specific platforms and give them a percentage of revenue for it. If you feel you own the idea, like I said, ideas are worthless, so honestly, just don&rsquo;t tell it to me (or say, &ldquo;sign this NDA&hellip;&rdquo;)</p>

<p>And have fun. If you&rsquo;re just trying to make money, you should be doing something else.</p>
