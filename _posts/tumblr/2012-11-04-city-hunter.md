This weekend’s Korean drama marathon: City Hunter. Good action, romance, humor (but not slapstick), and a pretty good plot. The soundtrack is excellent, especially in the action sequences:

It’s got a Batman vibe, but this hero’s girlfriend can kick ass and isn’t too obtuse to eventually figure out Clark Kent is Superman (OK, I’m mixing my superhero comparisons)
