<p>When I got my new MacBook Pro, I wasted nearly an afternoon playing with the Faces feature in iPhoto &lsquo;09, which lets you tag faces in a photo and then tries to automatically match them with others. The user interface isn&rsquo;t quite up to Apple standards - as I remember the Faces option presents itself when you import a photo, but when you go back to it later, Faces doesn&rsquo;t show up on the right-click menu of a photo, you have to find the button on the bottom of the window. I tried to demo it for some friends at Siggraph and couldn&rsquo;t remember how to to do it - I had to go to the Help section!</p>

<p>Nevertheless, once you get going, it&rsquo;s fun. At first, you&rsquo;re going to get a lot of seemingly-random results.</p>

<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2426" title="Picture 2" src="http://itshardtofondlepenguins.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/Picture-2-300x181.png" alt="Picture 2" width="300" height="181"/></p>

<p>But after a few iterations, it gets pretty good. Here, the only false matches for me are with my brother and my cousin.</p>

<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2427" title="Picture 3" src="http://itshardtofondlepenguins.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/Picture-3-300x188.png" alt="Picture 3" width="300" height="188"/></p>

<p>Lest you think that it&rsquo;ll alway match Asians with Asians, here it matches my Dad with my cousin-in-law of Greek extraction.</p>

<p><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2428" title="Picture 4" src="http://itshardtofondlepenguins.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/Picture-4-299x300.png" alt="Picture 4" width="299" height="300"/></p>

<p>And then sometimes it just can&rsquo;t find the face at all. Here it ignored my friend Sumanth and went for some shrubbery.</p>

<p>And it doesn&rsquo;t work with pets - I tried with my cat photos with no success. But there&rsquo;s another product idea!</p>
