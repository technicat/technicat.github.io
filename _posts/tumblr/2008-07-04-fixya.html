<p>My upgrade from MacOSX Tiger to Leopard went swimmingly compared to my Windows XP to Vista upgrade - slower, crashes frequently, lost compatibility with several applications, and lost support for a Microsoft codec! (Microsoft ADPCM 2, which turned out to be used for some training videos I wanted to view) Calling Vista an upgrade is stretching the term.</p>

<p>But I did have one annoying problem with Leopard - after upgrading drivers from the Epson site for my CX8400 color printer, it just started spitting out piles of mostly blank but partly garbaged pages. That&rsquo;s what I get for buying Mac peripherals at Office Depot instead of the Apple Store.</p>

<p>Web searches turned up a solution, not on the Epson or Apple sites, but on <a href="http://www.fixya.com/">FixYa</a>. Looks like a pretty useful site, browsing around I also found tips on another problem I have - how to fix my Toshiba laptop screen after I&rsquo;d dropped it on parking lot cement.</p>

<p>I was even tempted to join <a href="http://www.fixya.com/">FixYa</a> as an &ldquo;expert&rdquo; in the hopes of earning sweatshop wages for contributing helpful solutions, but once again I was displeased by the overly broad indemnification clause for the Experts terms of service, more onerous than the reasonably stated one for regular users of the site - limited to violations of the terms of service. Just as well - all the Google Adsense dollars, Epinions royalties, and various affiliate programs I&rsquo;ve joined over the years add up to perhaps one hour of my consulting time.</p>

<p>Now, let&rsquo;s see if it I can find a fix for my vacuum cleaner&hellip;</p>
