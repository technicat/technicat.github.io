<p>While updating my old Unity web players on <a href="http://fugugames.com/">Fugu Games</a>, I had some trouble testing because my browser wasn&rsquo;t loading the latest. Then I noticed the right-click/control-click context menu on the web player now includes a &ldquo;Setup&rdquo; option which brings you to a web page with options to clear and/or disable the web player cache.</p>

<p><a href="http://itshardtofondlepenguins.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/webplayercache.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3162" title="webplayercache" src="http://itshardtofondlepenguins.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/webplayercache.png" alt="" width="372" height="271"/></a></p>

<p>Normally, I disable the context menu (which is why I haven&rsquo;t noticed til now), but you can always just visit the <a href="http://cdn2.unity3.com/setup/">URL</a> directly. I recommend it - besides avoiding &ldquo;why isn&rsquo;t this working?&rdquo;, disabling the cache will ensure you&rsquo;re always aware of the web player load time. Now, I should start trimming the fat off those 10MB web players&hellip;</p>
