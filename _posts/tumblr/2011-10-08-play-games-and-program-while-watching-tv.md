I think this was my first Epinions review. You can probably tell just by reading it…

_Originally written on Epinions in May 2003:_

Last summer I had a very busy schedule that involved copious hours of video game play, television watching, and computer programming (I’m a video game programmer, so this is serious). I was looking for an LCD TV/monitor I could put on my coffee table for game/computer work while I watched my favorite shows on the big screen.

I found the standard screen version of this product (also available in widescreen) at Fry’s around the time it was introduced and snapped it up (at a price significantly higher than it is now), partly because I’ve had a good experience with a previous Samsung LCD monitor, and the LTM 1775 has HD support. I didn’t have HD reception, but I was interested in the progressive scan (480p) support for DVD and video game play.

Nine months later I can say this monitor is now integrated into my lifestyle. My XBox and Playstation 2 are hooked up to the two component video inputs, which are labeled DTV and DVD and accept the HD signals. My GameCube is hooked up to the video/S-video input, the PC connector is used when I run Linux on my PS2.

So I lay here on my sofa playing Halo while running software builds on PS2/Linux and watching Buffy the Vampire Slayer on my big screen. Technically, I could hook up my cable video to the remaining TV RF input on the monitor, in which case I might use the PIP feature that allows you to view the various TV inputs while in PC mode. (But in TV mode you can’t view the PC mode or any of the other TV modes)

The video quality is crisp and I did notice the progressive scan display is noticeably sharper when I played games supporting that mode. I’ve seen occasional flickering, which I attribute to flaky cables and switchboxes that I have attached. The monitor features built-in stereo speakers and a “virtual Dolby” mode. I’m no audiophile, but it sounds OK to me, better than cheapo computer speakers but nothing special. I would have liked an audio-out other than the headphone jack.

I’ve folded up the base stand, and taken the monitor to work, but scratched and smeared the screen a bit. It’s pretty light, but would have been easier to carry if it had a handle.
