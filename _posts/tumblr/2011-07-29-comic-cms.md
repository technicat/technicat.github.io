I used one of the URL’s I have lying around waiting for a purpose and tried out [Comic CMS](http://comiccms.com/) on [http://itshardtofondlepenguins.com/](http://itshardtofondlepenguins.com/), filling it with my [WordsEye](http://wordseye.com/) images instead of comics, since I can’t draw. It looks OK - it seems to me I’d have more options by using WordPress, but I am tempted to modify it to display Unity webplayers.
