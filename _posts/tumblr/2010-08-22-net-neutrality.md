A few years ago I attended a talk at the Santa Ana Digital Media Center given an executive from an online gaming company. Someone asked for his opinion on net neutrality and I was startled that he 1) didn’t know what it was, and 2) answered anyway that it didn’t concern him and that the free market would take care of it anyway. I’ll just pose a simple scenario - let’s say Time Warner cable strikes a deal to give broadband preference to a particular game, say WoW or Starcraft, or one of the games developed by a Time Warner studio, and conversely downgrades performance for your game. You’re hosed.

Here’s a nice quick-start graphic on net neutrality, including the latest news of Google once again stepping on and off the moral high ground.
