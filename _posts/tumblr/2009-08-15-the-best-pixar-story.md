I haven’t seen Pixar’s [Up](http://disney.go.com/disneypictures/up/), yet. I’ve heard rave recommendations for it, but this real-life [story](http://www.ocregister.com/articles/pixar-up-movie-2468059-home-show) that took place here in Huntington Beach beats them all. I admire Pixar’s classiness in not playing it up.
