The ragdoll is a fairly modern game engine feature that is just dying to be used (I remember on Darkwatch the game designers went nuts with them) and is&nbsp; surprisingly effective (look at Ragdoll Kung-Fu). Ragdoll Blaster combines ragdolls with a neat visual style. Hereâ€™s a screenshot from Ragdoll Blaster Lite.

Also using a hand-drawn style is a nifty iPhone app called Trace. Here you actually sketch the surface for your character to move along. Reminds me of Kid Pix, but adding gameplay!
