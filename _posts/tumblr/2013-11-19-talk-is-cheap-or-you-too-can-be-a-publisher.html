<p>When someone keeps asking for a phone call and doesn&rsquo;t give you any details until the third email, you know it&rsquo;s not going to be a good deal. So I wasn&rsquo;t surprised to find out they wanted to publish one of my apps without giving me an advance.

</p><blockquote>
<div dir="ltr">We typically don&rsquo;t offer an advance on earnings, though we&rsquo;ve been consistently able to improve our published partners&rsquo; revenue. We can&rsquo;t guarantee revenue because much of it relies on the game itself, though we are confident in being able to secure 100,000 installs in just a few weeks. With this boost, a game of HyperBowl&rsquo;s quality should be able to monetize quite effectively</div></blockquote>

That sounds like a great business model. Hey, all you developers out there, I&rsquo;ll be happy to publish your app, as long as I get a cut of the revenue and don&rsquo;t have to put any money down. I sort-of-not-really promise you&rsquo;ll make money!
