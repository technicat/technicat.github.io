My enjoyment in watching the US Open was marred, not for the first time, by the commentator’s obsession of the nationalities of the individual players. John MacEnroe isn’t too bad with this, but Dick Enberg won’t shut up about it. During one of Federer’s matches, I was reminded four times in one sitting that his opponent is an “Aussie”, and his next opponent I learned was a “Spaniard”, and they never fail to mention the Russian women (“and another Russian…”), although there was some discussion on how Sharapova was really only half Russian, and then how “patriots” in the stands would be rooting the for the remaining American.

I’m not saying this&nbsp; is totally irrelevant and uninteresting information, but in no other sport outside of the Olympics, not even the nationally mixed NBA or a similarly individual and international sport like golf, do I hear this kind of incessant labelling. It reminds me of the “where are you really from” queries I used to get a lot (not so much here in California, but, for example, in Henry Louis Gates’ city of Cambridge). Interestingly, I don’t hear some of the top players designated by their nationalities so much, e.g. Federer - perhaps it seems disrepectful. The commentators had a chuckle over how Oudin didn’t know about her French ancestry on her father’s side until she was asked about it at the tennis tournament. Maybe that’s more a comment about the tennis world.
