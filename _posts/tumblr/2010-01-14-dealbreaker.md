In the series 30 Rock, Liz Lemon has a popular relationship-advice comment, “Dealbreaker!” That’s a pretty good way to appraise some potential clients.

For example, I recently received an email from a potential client asking for a quote. I first heard from this guy a year ago when he asked me for some source code that I had licensed, saying he was directed to me by the licensor. Turns he hadn’t actually asked the licensor for the source code, he had contacted them on a completely different issue. And then he informed the licensor that I had volunteered the source code to him. You have to admire the symmetry, but dealbreaker!

This person also evinced a total disregard for my time. When I emailed him that I found some bags labelled as containing some specific interface boards that he might be interested in, he emailed me back asking “what’s in the bags?” What do you think, Doritos? Then he asked me to send an entire computer to him, promising to send it back and even generously to pay for its return, but not to cover the cost of me sending it. Dealbreaker!

And he only bothered to email me when he wanted something. After spending a week rooting around for some code that he said he needed and uploading it to him, no acknowledgment. When I informed him I’d be travelling near his office and would be willing to meet, nothing. But a month later, “Oh, sorry, I was working on something else, but can you help me with this?” When I made it clear I expected to be paid for working one someone else’s project, he invited to me to submit a quote, “as long as it’s reasonable”. Dealbreaker!

Ironically, if he’d dealt straight with me in the beginning, I might have fiddled around with the code and come up with a tweak they could use. But now, a year later, I’m loth to take the project even if my quote is met. Who needs a client that you can’t trust, is reluctant to pay, and doesn’t answer your email? Dealbreaker!
