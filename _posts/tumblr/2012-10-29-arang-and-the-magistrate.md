Arang and the Magistrate ended recently with this very cute scene. Of course, it makes more sense if you watched the previous nineteen episodes. I highly recommend it - nice blend of action, romance and comedy. And it’s got ghosts (there’s some excellent ghost-fighting scenes - the lead is a third-degree black belt, I’ve read). The only thing that bugged me was the gods in charge of heaven and hell - bunch of jerks who caused a lot of trouble for our heroes with bad decision-making. That’s upper management for you.
