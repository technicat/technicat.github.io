<p>I finally got around to trying <a href="http://www.appyfacefighter.com/">FaceFighter</a>, the second app from my friends at <a href="http://appyentertainment.com/">Appy Entertainment</a></p>

<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2210" title="IMG_0028" src="http://itshardtofondlepenguins.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/IMG_0028.jpg" alt="IMG_0028" width="480" height="320"/></p>

<p>It&rsquo;s some good old-fashioned button-mashing fun (or maybe that&rsquo;s just the way I play).</p>

<p>The Appy blog is generally quite entertaining, too, but, albeit on a more melancholy note, this <a href="http://goldenboat.wordpress.com/2009/07/07/mj/">personal reminiscence of Michael Jackson</a> by Project Directory Emmanuel Valdez is worth a read.</p>
