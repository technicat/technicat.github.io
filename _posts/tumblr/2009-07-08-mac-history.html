<p>I saw a magazine article (the now defunct Conde Nast Portfolio, I think) listing the &ldquo;worst&rdquo; CEO&rsquo;s of all time, and John Sculley made the list. I think that&rsquo;s unfair. Conventional wisdom has it that he took a great company and tanked it. Conventional wisdom also had it that Apple should have licensed their technology to other companies. Steve Jobs nixed that when he returned, and you don&rsquo;t hear that criticism, anymore. There was a great product run during the Sculley years, from the original Mac, to the MacSE, the Mac II line, and the Newton. Yeah, I said it, the Newton. C'mon, that was a really cool product. Remember those guys who took over after him? Yeah, neither do I. During those years, and including the first years of Jobs&rsquo; return, I pretty much gave up on Apple, thought the OS was going nowhere, didn&rsquo;t even like the looks of the new models (not even the early iMacs) and I didn&rsquo;t test the waters again until 2005. And during that whole time, I hated Windows, so it&rsquo;s not like I was happily programming on something else. But now I&rsquo;m back in the fold, and after buying my latest MacBook Pro, realize looking back that I haven&rsquo;t owned as much Mac hardware as I thought, but I&rsquo;ve been an Apple guy for a long time.
</p><ul><li>1981 - Transferred mid-year to a new junior high school, discovered an Apple II in the school library, went through the AppleSoft Basic tutorials on drawing graphics - suddenly understood the coolness of programming.</li>
	<li>1982 - Dad purchased an Apple II, started writing Basic programs (wire-frame surface display, pi calculators, Othello) and dabbled in machine language (a word processor, another Othello program) - the latter didn&rsquo;t work right but ran fast!</li>
	<li>1983 - First paying programming job, making minor Apple II program fixes for CONDUIT, the university group for educational software. I think they were unimpressed.</li>
	<li>1984 - My first sight of a Mac, at a friend&rsquo;s place. Dazzled by MacWrite - fonts! Proportional spacing! Black text on a white background!</li>
	<li>1985 - Worked at continuing studies center of MIT maintaining their computer lab - all Macs! Used those same Macs to write tech press briefs for a public relations company.</li>
	<li>1985 - Summer job at the campus computer store - talked with Marvin Minsky over the phone, saw the Apple Lisa, saw the Apple Lisa burn out, sold a bunch of Macs, hated the boss (first bad boss)</li>
	<li>1994 - After joining a company that had dial-up Internet access (BBN), finally got my own Mac, the model with a DOS card so I could see what the MS fuss was about. Saw Doom, liked Marathon better.</li>
	<li>1996 - Got a Mac PowerBook from Fry&rsquo;s, the first in  a series of used computers they sold me as new. Opened it to find a partially filled out registration card and System 7 in mid-install (disk 5 out of 10). Otherwise, it was a great computer and allowed local two-player networked Marathon matches.</li>
	<li>1998 - Purchased a Performa for no good reason. Played Myth, that was about it. System 8 was pretty creaky.  Stopped running after a year - I heard that the clock probably just needed a new battery.</li>
	<li>2005 - Decided to test the Mac waters again with a Mac Mini. I can develop again! Unix, Java, open source tools&hellip;but with 256MB just don&rsquo;t try playing games or running Eclipse.</li>
	<li>2006 - New contract requires a machine with horsepower, or so I rationalize, so I buy the new MacBook Pro. Good thing - I give up on my DSL provider and end up doing my work at Starbucks.</li>
	<li>2006 - New contract has a boss who yells a lot. I buy an iPod nano.</li>
	<li>2007 - 512MB is still painful. Throwing in another 1GB memory card eases the pain.</li>
	<li>2008 - Now I&rsquo;m out of disk space. 60GB doesn&rsquo;t cut it, anymore. Went with the LaCie Rugged in the hope of keeping a device running more than a year.</li>
	<li>2009 - MacBook Pro, after months of wheezing, starts crashing. Fortunately had Time Machine running with the LaCie - provides near-seamless transition to the replacement, a 13&quot; MacBook Pro. The screen is small, but the price is right (at least, compared to other Macs).</li>
</ul>
