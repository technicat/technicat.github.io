I’ve been an iPhone developer for about twenty months, now, and this is what it’s cost me:

- $99/year to register as an Apple developer (call it $200 total)
- $1500 for Unity iPhone plus $500 for the impending upgrade to Unity 3.0 ($2000 total)
- $100 for the [Unity iPhone Enhancement Pack](http://stinkbot.com/)
- $75 to place ads on [AppBoy](http://appboy.com/)
- $75 to commission a [promo video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5O7QDG12Fxc) from&nbsp; [SlapApp](http://slappapp.com/)
- estimated $200 on iPhone development books (probably an underestimate - I’m a bit embarrassed about how much I spend on books)
- $240 on a 2nd-gen iPod touch
- $500 on an iPad (this blog should be called the Cost of iPhone and iPad Development)
- $50 on iPhone/iPad accessories
- $30 on [AppViz](http://appviz.com/) to track app sales
- $200 on iPhone and iPad apps
I omitted a lot of expenses that I arguably would have incurred, anyway, for example Unity iPhone is an add-on to Unity, so I spent $2000 on Unity Pro (again, $1500 and then $500 for the upgrade). And I’m not counting my Mac hardware purchases (I’ve gone through two MacBook Pro’s, a couple of external drives, a monitor…). I am including everything iPhone and iPad related, because I’m pretty sure I wouldn’t have bought either one if I wasn’t developing for them (I still use a Blackberry Pearl as my phone). I haven’t bothered to calculate the sales tax - in California it’s nearly 10% (consider making all your Apple hardware purchases in Oregon). As for marketing, I’m only listing expenses on marketing specifically for my iPhone apps (specifically for [HyperBowl](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/hyperbowl/id344209253?mt=8)). The final tally is $3500-$4000, let’s say $4000 if I really have to pick a number, with the most going to [Unity](http://unity3d.com/), second most going to Apple, and the least going to marketing. That should probably change, especially since HyperBowl seems to be at a stage where it’s getting predominantly five-star ratings from buyers, so features (or bugs) don’t seem to be the obstacle to increased sales. And I’m not in a hurry to push out the next version, which will involve a major conversion to Unity 3.0 (still in beta) and will be iPad and iOS4 only (as you can see, my hardware budget does not involve a plethora of test devices). So far I’ve just spent marketing money on sites where I feel the people are cool and deal with you fairly. I had a [developer interview on Appboy](http://blog.appboy.com/2009/11/interview-philip-chu-they-dont-make-em-like-they-used-to/) and a [HyperBowl review](http://www.slapapp.com/hyperbowl) and some promo code distributions on SlapApp before paying for their services. Contrast that to a site that recently asked me for a HyperBowl promo code so they could review it, and then after receiving a set of codes they asked me to pay for them to interview me and write a review. Yuck. And then there are many not quite so brazen that will ask you to pay for an “expedited” review. I know there are 200,000+ apps out there, but I’d like to think there aren’t that many desperate developers. I do have to admit, if Apple ever decided to auction off visibility on the App Store, they could make a mint off that. Actually, that sort of happens - if you’re on the “top grossing” list, Apple’s making out too.
