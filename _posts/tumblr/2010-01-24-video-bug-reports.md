I used to be one of those programmers who complained about receiving terribly vague bug reports that resemble my nephew’s account of how he got a coin stuck up his nose ( “I didn’t do anything…”). Now I’m on the other side - recently I submitted a report in which I described step-by-step how to reproduce the bug from a newly-created project, and I got a reflexive “can you attach a project” response for my trouble.

I fear now that we’re in the texting and YouTube era, bug reports will require video. I’ve even seen one game QA group attach or link movies to their bug reports on their own initiative (I think it was Darkwatch, but I’m not sure). I found one [HyperBowl](http://hyperbowl3d.com/) bug demonstrated on YouTube, which was good motivation for getting it fixed…(I can prioritize bugs based on the number of YouTube views)
