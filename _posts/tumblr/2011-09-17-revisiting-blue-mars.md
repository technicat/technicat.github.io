With the new mobile version of [Blue Mars](http://bluemars.com/) and the desktop client with Google Maps integration (and Mac support, yay!), it’s easy to forget about the original PC client featuring the “full” Blue Mars experience. But after cleaning up my PC (why is the C drive always the smallest?), I reinstalled Blue Mars and and discovered a lot of good-looking stuff I hadn’t seen before. Here’s just a couple of screenshots, one from ARAF and the other from a factory (Middletown?) with some industrious NPC’s.
