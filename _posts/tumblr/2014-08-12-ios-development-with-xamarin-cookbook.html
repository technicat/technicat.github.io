<p>I&rsquo;ve been trying out Xamarin (formely known as Monotouch) again for a couple of months, now, after a brief flirtation with Xamarin Android last fall. In the latter case, it wasn&rsquo;t clear to me that developing apps in C# and Mono was all that much more convenient than Java and the ADT, but I&rsquo;ve spent the last several years avoiding Objective-C programming using Unity, so Xamarin seemed to fit the bill.</p>

<p>So far it&rsquo;s been working well, with the exception of the occasional compiler mystery (tip: use the new reference counter, selected in the project options), in no small part due to the excellent documentation. In some cases, Xamarin provides more easily digestible explanations of iOS features than Apple does on their developer site. However, there are still gaps, and this is still middleware, so we&rsquo;re still dealing with an additional layer of stuff to learn over what you&rsquo;re still supposed to learn. This is where I like to cuddle up on my sofa with a good book and a season DVD set over the weekend and do a quick dump into my brain.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/ios-development-xamarin-cookbook">iOS Development with Xamarin Cookbook</a> isn&rsquo;t quite that book, as it&rsquo;s a &ldquo;cookbook&rdquo; of recipes demonstrating various iOS API&rsquo;s and how they&rsquo;re used from Xamarin. However, I&rsquo;ve been referencing it over the last couple of weeks after I received a review copy of the ebook from Packt, and I was pleased to find a good deal of basic explanation, not suprisingly well elucidated by the author, Dimitros Tavlikos, as he&rsquo;s a &ldquo;Xamarin MVP.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Anyone new to iOS (and who has chosen Xamarin to avoid dealing with Xcode and Objective-C) will appreciate the primer on Xcode, Interface Builder, nib files, views, and so on. I prefer to avoid any visual design and have everything in code, so I would have liked some more recipes that didn&rsquo;t start from Interface Builder, but nevertheless, those walkthroughs did clear up some of the mystery there for me.</p>

<p>Much of the user interface explanation I&rsquo;ve already found on the Xamarin site in the form of separate articles, but it is nice to have a good deal of that readable at once in a single book. I could actually use a bit more in the way of table customization, for example, but I understand this is a recipe book. I have, in fact, used some of the recipes, already, including goodies like the text messaging and text-to-speech. I&rsquo;m looking forward to trying out others in the book such as voice recording, view animation, and maps (there is an extensive treatment of that topic)</p>

<p>Note: Xamarin 3.0 was released only recently, so the book probably doesn&rsquo;t mention any 3.0-specific features (at least, I haven&rsquo;t noticed, any), including the cross-platform Xamarin Forms feature.</p>
