<p>I received a nice letter from the <a href="http://cbldf.org/">Comic Book Legal Defense Fund</a> thanking me for my membership and relating cases of interest to their mission. That&rsquo;s a typical courtesy of charities but what struck me as unusual was what wasn&rsquo;t in the letter - an appeal for more money. Every other thank-you letter I&rsquo;ve received from a charity has been a thank-you-may-I-have-another letter, which reminds me of the heroin addicts who used to accost me in Baltimore (&ldquo;Can you spare a dollar? Thanks. Can you spare five?&rdquo;), or maybe of startup companies. In any case, contrary to the stereotype of comic book fans as socially inept, here&rsquo;s a case where they seem further up on their Ms. Manners than &ldquo;professionals&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Another example is <a href="http://comic-con.org/">Comic Con</a>. The show is run by a non-profit organization staffed by volunteers, and it is the best-run, best-value and most fun event I&rsquo;ve attended (compared to E3, GDC, Siggraph, Tokyo Game Show&hellip;)</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d feel a lot better if I knew there were some comic book fans in the Obama administration.</p>
