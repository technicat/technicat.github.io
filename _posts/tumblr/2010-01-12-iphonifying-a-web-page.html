<p>Safari on the iPhone does a pretty good job of viewing regular web pages, but the browsing experience can be vastly improved by tailoring a page for the iPhone (compare the Mobile vs. Standard view of the Twitter site on the iPhone).</p>

<p>This is particularly true for the <a href="http://hyperbowl3d.com/">HyperBowl</a> page, which replicates the 800x600 PC game, and moreover displays additional product information to the right.</p>

<p><a href="http://itshardtofondlepenguins.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/Picture-7.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3020" title="Picture 7" src="http://itshardtofondlepenguins.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/Picture-7.png" alt="" width="593" height="360"/></a></p>

<p>First, I added a style sheet that only loads when browsing from the iPhone. This style sheet contains settings that overrides the original.</p>

<p>Then I specify the viewport width is the width of the iPhone screen. Otherwise, we&rsquo;ll start out at the default page width (960 pixels, I think) and have to zoom in to read.</p>

<p>And here&rsquo;s the result. Not as fancy, but a lot more readable!</p>
