<p>If there&rsquo;s one thing I&rsquo;ve learned from Linsanity, it&rsquo;s that Asian Americans, or at least Chinese Americans, are associated with fortune cookies (along with imperfections in armor, dynasties and emperors, bowing, martial arts, and small genitalia). After seeing Jeremy Lin&rsquo;s face displayed in a giant fortune cookie on the Madison Square Garden jumbotron,  fortune cookies have made an appearance  in the Linsanity ice cream that Ben and Jerry rushed out in what looks like the type of make-a-fast-buck move taken by those writing ebooks in 24 hours and registering Lin-related trademarks. Limiting the distribution to Boston doesn&rsquo;t make me feel any better - I&rsquo;ve heard more dumb racial comments in Boston than anywhere else (gems like &ldquo;you guys don&rsquo;t like Koreans, right?&rdquo; and &ldquo;do you speak English?&rdquo;)</p>

<p>The ice cream has since been modified, with lychee replacing the fortune cookie, along with a disappointingly corporate non-apology apology (&ldquo;if anyone was offended&hellip;&rdquo;) and lame story (they said the fortune cookies were removed from the recipe because they got soggy - well, duh, that just reinforces the notion that they put it out there without thinking).</p>

<p>But just trying to make the ice cream ethnic is still missing the lesson. Sure, lychee is at least an authentic Asian food (I hope we don&rsquo;t see a French-fry flavored Tony Parker ice cream), but how would it go over if an ice cream branded for an African American player was flavored with fried chicken, or native ingredients from Africa? See, it&rsquo;s either insulting or stupid. If an ice cream for an American player with English ancestry was flavored with kidney pie, the reaction would be &ldquo;huh?&rdquo; (and, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s disgusting&rdquo;)</p>

<p>Now, for example,a Krispy Kreme ice cream for Charles Barkeley would make sense - that has the personal touch and I bet he&rsquo;d be on board for that. I somehow doubt that Ben and Jerry asked Jeremy Lin for his favorite foods - they apparently just checked the menu at Panda Express.</p>
