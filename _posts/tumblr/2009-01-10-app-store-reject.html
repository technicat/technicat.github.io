<p>The <a href="http://www.apple.com/iphone/appstore/">App Store</a> seems to  provide the advantages of console programming (target fixed hardware) along with a convenient way to self-publish. But each submission is subject to Apple approval. I haven&rsquo;t heard of too many rejections, but I have heard of a few, and I got my first one recently. After silence on the approval front over several weeks, this little demo of mocap from <a href="http://www.elektrashock.com/">ElektraShock</a> got rejected for &ldquo;not providing enough user functionality&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Getting started on <a href="http://developer.apple.com/iphone/program/">iPhone software development</a> compares favorably to the ordeal of console development (check out the <a href="http://www.warioworld.com/apply/">Wii developer requirements </a>) But there is no App Store equivalent to the concept approval element of console projects, so you run the risk of investing a lot into an app that Apple ultimately rejects. (not that I put a lot of work into this one - it&rsquo;s a vastly trimmed down version of a browser demo on <a href="http://www.fugugames.com/">Fugu Games</a>)</p>
