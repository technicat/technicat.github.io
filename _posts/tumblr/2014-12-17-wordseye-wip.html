<p>Every app is an opportunity to try something new and test some ideas. For the WordsEye iOS app, I&rsquo;m using Xamarin, partly because there&rsquo;s potential for cross-platform reuse of some code, partly because I&rsquo;ll do anything to avoid programming in Objective-C, and partly because I paid for a license and I should use it for something.</p>

<p>As for app design, I really wanted to make sure you don&rsquo;t have to log in until you really need to log in. Anytime I randomly try an app that presents me with a login right in the beginning, I delete it. Thus the WordsEye app drops you into the WordsEye Gallery immediately and lets you browse and share scenes and hopefully induces them to register as WordsEye users. Among the art/photo apps I looked at, Behance does this, but not a lot of others.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://wordseye.com/">WordsEye web site</a> has a mix of features, including social features, activity feeds, and leaderboards, and that&rsquo;s a lot of screens to cram into an app. For now, I&rsquo;m using a combination of tabs and page view controllers (horizontal swiping among screens), like how the twitter feeds are organized, but frankly, the way twitter does it is really fancy - I&rsquo;m thinking of going to something more like pinterest. So here are some work-in-progress screenshots before I make my umpteenth makeover. And if you want to try it out (via Apple&rsquo;s Testflight, which seems to work pretty well), just drop me a line. Only 992 spots left!</p>
