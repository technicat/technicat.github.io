I barely managed to get HyperBowl 2.1 submitted to the App Store just before Thanksgiving, so I could spend the holiday eating instead of working. Not surprisingly, that added a few days to the typical approval period, so it didn’t show up on the App Store until yesterday.

This release includes the sixth and final lane, Tokyo. It’s also the hugest lane, so like San Francisco, it only runs on HD devices (it’s pretty, but not running at 5fps on a 2nd-gen iPod touch)

This version also supports Game Center on the iPad, as long as you’re running iOS 4.2. I wonder if this explains the recent increase in HyperBowl players on the Game Center leaderboards. For a while it was stuck at seven, but in the last few days, there have been a few new ones each day. Next update - achievements!
