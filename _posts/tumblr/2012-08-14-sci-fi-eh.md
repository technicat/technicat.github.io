Below is a [list from Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_science_fiction_TV_and_radio_shows_produced_in_Canada) of scifi TV shows filmed in Canada since 2010. That’s just since 2010, and just sci-fi shows. Imagine the list since 2000, for example (also in the same wikipedia page if you’re curious) and expand it to all genres. And think about movies. The reason I bring this up is that when people complain about jobs going to other countries, it’s always Mexico or an Asian country. I hear this from white Californians, Fox TV (and CNN until Lou Dobbs left) and campaigns from both parties during election season&nbsp;(“Bangalore!” and “Beijing!” featured prominently in Meg Whitman’s campaign, and the Obama campaign is uttering “Mexico!” and “China!” against Romney - it’s nice to see such bipartisanship). I have yet to hear a complaint about film production and acting jobs going to “[Hollywood North](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollywood_North)”, or any other type of jobs (there is a Canadian auto industry, and check out all the hi-tech offices EA, IBM and Microsoft opened there). But I suspect if filming moved down to Mexico (or Bollywood), you’ll start hearing about it.
