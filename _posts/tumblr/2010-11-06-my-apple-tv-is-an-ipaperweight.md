It’s not often that I experience buyer’s remorse after a trip to the Apple Store, but I think my purchase of an Apple TV was a mistake. The demo didn’t look that interesting in the store, but the device itself sure looked cool, and dare I say, cute. Then there was all the hype about its announcement, it was sold out when I first asked about it at the store, and at $99, I figured, why not.

First of all, unusual for an Apple product, my first experience was marred by the lack of an included HDMI cable. OK, the store rep did ask me if I needed one, but I thought I had one or two at home already and I didn’t want to buy one unnecessarily. So I unpacked the Apple TV, plugged it in, looked around for an HDMI cable and couldn’t find one, and thus the box lay around for a week. Then the Apple effect kicked in again - I was going to get a cable from any old store, but out of curiousity I checked the Apple Store online and saw the Apple-branded HDMI cable got some rave reviews (for a cable?), so I went back to the Apple Store just to pick up a cable.

The setup was pretty easy, and the remote is tiny and simple (reminiscent of an early iPod nano) although it’s no fun typing in iTunes and wifi logins with the thing. I entered my YouTube account, too, but the YouTube interface is limited, just showing Favorites and Featured, not, for example, My Videos. And I felt slightly nauseous after watching a couple of videos, I guess because of the frame rate. I’ll stick to my iPad for YouTube viewing.

The main reason for getting the Apple TV, the rental store, is really disappointing. The movies have a limited selection, and all those $1.99 rentals you heard about are a small subset of them, none of which I felt like watching. I checked on of the new releases, Splice, at $3.99, and then looked at a not-so-new release, one of the Stargate movies, which was $4.99. I’d rather talk a walk to the nearest Redbox and rent a movie for $.99 (I need the exercise, anyway).

The TV episode selection is even more limited, with only a few networks. No Syfy, for example, Most of the shows are from ABC (many of which I watch for free on the ABC Player on my iPad). The $.99 rental (for 48 hours) is appealing, but consider I’ve been downloading episodes on my PS3 for $1.99 each and those are sales. Right now I’m getting my money’s worth by rewatching a season of Veronica Mars. I did find one episode on iTunes that I did want to watch - the finale of Defying Gravity (can you call the last episode of a prematurely cancelled series a “finale”?) which was inexplicably missing from the Playstation Store. The rental process wasn’t too bad, but it was a little confusing - when I clicked Rent, it prompted for an iTunes login, some credit card info, and then put me back at the Rent screen again. I wasn’t sure if I was supposed to click the button again or if that would result in a double-charge (I guess I’ll find out). When I did click again, after a short while, it told me it was downloaded and ready to play. I’d have felt better if there was some progress indicator and if it was clear whether it was streaming or really completely downloaded. Nevertheless, it played fine, and that was a really good episode - I would have looked forward to a second season of Defying Gravity.

Now, back to Veronica Mars.
