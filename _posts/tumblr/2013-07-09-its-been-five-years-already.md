I was surprised to hear that the App Store is five years old this week. I thought I’d been on the App Store longer than that. I guess it just feels that way, but in any case, here’s how my four-and-a-half year record on the App Store looks, according to AppViz.

The most important number is the total revenue. In that respect, I slowly ramped up over three years and it’s tapered off since. The untold story here is that I’ve added Android revenue since then, but still, those were the glory days.

The sales (unit downloads not counting upgrades) graph looks depressingly like a flatline, but I can blame (rationalize) that on a few peak days. I just wish I had more peak days.

App updates don’t attract attention like they used to (the App Store originally displayed a running list of updates), but it’s nice to see there’s an installed base of your apps out there.

This graph of ad impressions shows the point where I started experimenting with ads on one app and then eventually embraced them wholeheartedly.
