<p>I just discovered the Emo-Ray game I worked on at Heavy Water over a year ago has been ovailable on Playstation@Home for a few months, now. Nice to see they included my name on the credit list displayed in the public area for the game (five programmers, total). At first, I didn&rsquo;t remember doing much on the game - I worked there part time for three months on at least four different projects - but looking at the video, yeah, I did some HUD work (if there&rsquo;s any constant theme in my contract work, it&rsquo;s HUD), multiple camera support, FMV player&hellip;of course, there&rsquo;s probably been a lot of code rewriting since then. But who knows, I&rsquo;ve had former coworkers tell me they haven&rsquo;t changed my code in the years since I&rsquo;ve left (I don&rsquo;t know if that&rsquo;s a good or bad thing).</p>
