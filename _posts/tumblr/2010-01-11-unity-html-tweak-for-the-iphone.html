<p>It was really bugging me that the Install Unity badge was appearing when I visited the <a href="http://hyperbowl3d.com/">HyperBowl</a> page on my iPod touch. Of course, clicking (tapping) on it isn&rsquo;t going to do anything useful. The basic problem is that the default HTML generated for Unity web players assumes that if the web player isn&rsquo;t installed, you can install it (there was an exception for the incompatibility with 64-bit Safari running on Snow Leopard, but reportedly that&rsquo;s not a problem, anymore).

After meddling with the Javascript for a while, I settled on checking for &ldquo;iPhone&rdquo; in the navigator.appVersion property and adding that to the conditional wrapping the code that generates the badge link:
</p><blockquote>if ((navigator.appVersion.indexOf(&ldquo;iPhone&rdquo;)
== -1) &amp;&amp; (!hasUnity || brokenUnity))</blockquote>
A similar test for Linux might be useful, too.
