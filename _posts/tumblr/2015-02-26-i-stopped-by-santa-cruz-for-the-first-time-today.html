I like that town: in just a couple of hours, I browsed a great indie bookstore (Bookshop Santa Cruz) that even has a good computer section, had a long chat about comic books with the owner of Atlantis Fantasyland (and I&rsquo;m not even much of a comic book reader), and had an excellent &ldquo;Mexicali&rdquo; coffee at Caffe Bene. That was just long enough to almost get a parking ticket, but the parking enforcement lady voided the ticket and entered as a reason, &ldquo;he has a nice smile.&rdquo; Did I mention I like that town? I haven&rsquo;t even checked out the boardwalk and beach, yet.</p>
