<p>&ldquo;Apple and our customers place a high value on simple, refined, creative, well thought through interfaces. They take more work but are worth it. Apple sets a high bar. If your user interface is complex or less than very good, it may be rejected&rdquo;</p><p>This is annoying because 1) it has that arrogant tone and 2) this rejection was for an app update. It&rsquo;s already in the store and you won&rsquo;t let me update it? This is why I don&rsquo;t like making iOS-only apps.<br/></p>
