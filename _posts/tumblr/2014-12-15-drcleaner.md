I’m constantly running out of disk space on my MacBook Pro, especially when I’m running Unity and Xamarin, so, ironically prompted by an annoying ad for a paid tool, I finally looked around on the Mac App Store for some a free disk cleaner utility and tried out Dr.Cleaner from Trend Micro. Basically, it does what I’ve been doing manually, but better. Amazingly, I cleaned out 15GB in log files this morning!
