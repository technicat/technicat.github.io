<p>Despite it&rsquo;s size and cost, I can&rsquo;t type more than a few words at a time on my Toshiba Satellite laptop without hitting an up-arrow key and scrambling the line above, which is harder to recover from than your standard mistype-then-backspace. Which is just one more reason why I do as much of my work as possible on my MacBook Pro.</p>

<p>Finally, I compared the Toshiba keyboard with every other keyboard I have lying around, and the problem is obvious - the right shift key is the same size as a regular key.</p>

<p>But you can see here the left shift key is normal-sized, meaning it&rsquo;s the width of almost three regular keys.</p>

<p>With the right shift key, I&rsquo;m hitting what would normally be the correct spot for a shift key, but instead Toshiba elected to cram in the arrow keys there. If I was a hunt-and-peck typist, that probably wouldn&rsquo;t matter, but now I&rsquo;m trapped between a keyboard redesign and thirty-years of touch-typing.</p>
