<p>After a handful of sales, the first review for <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00703SOLC">my Kindle book</a> on software development has appeared, and it&rsquo;s a really complimentary one (it&rsquo;s well-written, too  - I&rsquo;m a little concerned that the review has a better writing style than my book). Here are a couple of lines from it:
</p><blockquote>You can easily imagine yourself having a drink with him at some computer show or conference, and being struck by his blunt pronouncements. But over that drink or two, you&rsquo;ll come to find yourself agreeing with his style, because it&rsquo;s a results-oriented style.</blockquote>
I think I owe him that drink or two. Thanks, Rick!
