While updating my old Unity web players on [Fugu Games](http://fugugames.com/), I had some trouble testing because my browser wasn’t loading the latest. Then I noticed the right-click/control-click context menu on the web player now includes a “Setup” option which brings you to a web page with options to clear and/or disable the web player cache.

Normally, I disable the context menu (which is why I haven’t noticed til now), but you can always just visit the [URL](http://cdn2.unity3.com/setup/) directly. I recommend it - besides avoiding “why isn’t this working?”, disabling the cache will ensure you’re always aware of the web player load time. Now, I should start trimming the fat off those 10MB web players…
