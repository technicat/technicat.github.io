<p>After some of my neighbors figured out I was a programmer and asked me to help them (&ldquo;click there&hellip;no there&hellip;no, left click&hellip;&rdquo;) I I was tempted to get one of those t-shirts that say &ldquo;Fix your own @#$% computer!&rdquo;, but that would probably invite queries and thus backfire. Maybe a shirt saying, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not an IT person&rdquo;.

Nevertheless, I&rsquo;ve been looking into ways to provide some modern IT for our homeowner&rsquo;s association - ( for a while I was using the online repair request form on our management company&rsquo;s web site, but it turned out they didn&rsquo;t actually monitor it ). I just got elected to the HOA board (I got a condo instead of a house so I wouldn&rsquo;t have to deal with maintenance issues, so there goes that theory&hellip;), so I&rsquo;m really interested in a way to store and share documents and a group calendar with the other board members.

Google Apps seemed perfect. There&rsquo;s a free version which allows fifty users, which is plenty for my needs, although clicking on the features on the Apps web site kept bringing me to the Google Apps for Business page. I guess they decided it&rsquo;s time to make money off it. Anyway, setting it up wasn&rsquo;t too difficult. Oddly, Google Apps says the first domain I tried to register is already registered with Google Apps, which is a disturbing mystery, but I was able to get going with a subdomain, creating an admin user and then a test user, logging in as the latter and uploading a photo.

But then a day later, I was unable to log in, getting stuck in that captcha cycle, even after clearing the browser cache (which seemed to be the problem in earlier cases when I couldn&rsquo;t use one of my google logins). After logging in as admin, I saw test user was &ldquo;suspended for abuse&rdquo;. The Google help page said to go to the Support page and report it to start an investigation, but I didn&rsquo;t see any place on the Google Apps page to do that (most of the support options are for Google Apps for Business - yeah, yeah, I get the idea), but there&rsquo;s a link to the forum. I found a couple of year-old posts on similar situations, one with a link to an answer thread that is now missing (this reminds me of my Android troubleshooting) and another fortunately with a link to a problem report form, which I promptly used. Within a few hours, I got a response:


</p><blockquote>
Thank you for your message. I understand that a newly created user has been suspended in your domain.

It appears that there has been unusual activity on your account over the past 24 hours.  If we detect this, it may indicate that your account has been compromised or being used for malicious purposes, and therefore we may temporarily disable access. It usually takes up to 24 hours for access to be reinstated, depending on the behavior detected by our system. 

In this instance unusual activity could be receiving, deleting, or downloading large amounts of mail via POP or IMAP in a short period of time. Please note that if you use a POP or IMAP client (Microsoft Outlook or Apple Mail, e.g.), you may only send a message to 100 people at a time. For more information about uploading via IMAP, please visit <a href="http://mail.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=81312.">http://mail.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=81312.</a> 

This issue can also be caused by having too many simultaneous connections to one user account. Please view <a href="http://mail.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=97150">http://mail.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=97150</a> for additional information. 

If you think that you have been locked out of your account by mistake, please check that your mail client is not checking for new messages too often. We recommend that it should check the server once every 15 minutes for new messages. 

I hope this information has helped you resolve your issue.

I appreciate the promptness of the answer, but it didn&rsquo;t answer much. It didn&rsquo;t explain why the account was suspended, and all the talk about mail clients is irrelevant since I didn&rsquo;t use a mail client (I didn&rsquo;t even opt to set up GMail on that account when it initially prompted me to, but a GMail Inbox showed up anyway). The suggestion that it may be due to multiple logins holds more water, since I first logged in on my Mac and then later tried it out on my iPad on the sofa a few feet away. If that was the problem, there should be a big warning on the Google Apps page, &ldquo;Wait, log out before you use the account anywhere else!&rdquo; It seems to me instead of theorizing about why they suspended the account, they could actually tell me (or do they not know?)

More annoying is that they didn&rsquo;t tell me the account was suspended while I was trying to log in (after typing in several captchas you start do doubt your own sanity, or keyboard), and they didn&rsquo;t alert my admin account. If I actually proceed to use Google Apps for my HOA business and this happens with accounts I set up for the other board members, there are only two possible outcomes - a whole bunch of work for me trying to get those account reinstated (the part about the account being reinstated in 24 hours is not true, the account is still suspended, and the part about that being based on system activity doesn&rsquo;t make sense - if the account is suspended, what activity could they be monitoring on it?) or people will just figure it&rsquo;s too much trouble to use. Which is where I&rsquo;m at.
