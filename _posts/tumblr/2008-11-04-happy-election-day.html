<p>I was underwhelmed by last night&rsquo;s SNL pre-election &ldquo;bash&rdquo;, partly because it was mostly a best-of compilation of SNL presidential skits, but also because Sarah Palin&rsquo;s skit where she half-jokingly threatened the show and network with her upcoming vice-presidential powers came off as creepy. Maybe it was the writing, but I think it was the delivery.</p>

<p>She wasn&rsquo;t that funny in her first appearance on SNL, either. The hype over her, and Tina Fey&rsquo;s hysterical impression, has eclipsed John McCain&rsquo;s genuinely engaging humor, which was on display on Saturday.</p>



<p></p>



<p><br/>
I&rsquo;ve read both McCain&rsquo;s and Obama&rsquo;s books (The Faith of our Fathers, The Audacity of Hope). Obama is the better writer, but I found McCain&rsquo;s story more compelling. During the primaries, the only candidate in either party I found repellent was Tom Tancredo, but on the Republican side I was hoping for McCain and the Democratic side Bill Richardson. At that point, I was thinking if it was between McCain and Clinton, I&rsquo;d go with McCain. When it turned out to be Obama vs. McCain, I was ambivalent. I was impressed by the early endorsements of Richardson and Edwards. On the other hand, a lot of people seem to like McCain better, including the Clintons and Joe Lieberman. I&rsquo;m no Hillary fan, and I thought the charges of sexism brought by her supporters against the Obama campaign were  exaggerated, if not baseless, but Obama&rsquo;s &ldquo;You&rsquo;re likable enough&rdquo; comment to her during a debate showed he could be snide.</p>

<p>And while Obama&rsquo;s speeches are great, I&rsquo;m not so sure about his legislative record. McCain has mentioned Obama&rsquo;s abstentions, but apparently that&rsquo;s a snoozer of an issue compared to Wright/Ayres/socialism, and McCain could harp on how Obama cooperated on the McCain-Kennedy immigration reform only to tack on a union-appeasing amendment later before the bill tanked. But no one wants to sound sympathetic to illegal immigrants these days.</p>

<p>So I figured, let&rsquo;s wait and see who they pick for their VP slots, and see if it makes the decision easier. And it did. I might have voted for Biden when he was running for the top position years ago, but I can&rsquo;t imagine every voting Palin for president, even though there&rsquo;s already talk about Palin 2012.</p>

<p>So, basically, I&rsquo;m with John Stewart, who said on the Daily Show that he would have voted for McCain against Gore in 2000, but not the McCain campaigning this year. I&rsquo;ve heard some other persuasive arguments and endorsements, like that from Fareed Zakaria on his GPS show, but the most compelling I&rsquo;ve seen is from Colin Powell:</p>



<p>Although to be fair, Powell was also the one who convinced me we should invade Iraq.</p>

<p>However it turns out, I think it&rsquo;s gotta be an improvement over the last eight years, and I&rsquo;d like to thank both candidates for making one of the more exciting elections.
