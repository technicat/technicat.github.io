When I worked on the original HyperBowl game ten years ago, one of the first things I did was implement an on-screen FPS display. Itâ€™s deja vu all over again - in the most recent [HyperBowl](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/hyperbowl/id344209253?mt=8) update on the App Store, I added an FPS display option again, plus a display of various system information.
