<p>When I was enthusiastic about Asian food in California, I&rsquo;m not exaggerating. I really had almost negligible knowledge of Japanese food, Korean food, Thai food, and Vietnamese food before I moved here. Even Chinese food. Take this scallion pie, for instance. My Mom made this when I was a kid, but inventively substituted tortillas for the crust. It makes a difference. But maybe that tortilla version could catch on (fusion, right?)<br/><br/><a href="http://itshardtofondlepenguins.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/scallionpie.jpg"><img src="http://itshardtofondlepenguins.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/scallionpie-500x281.jpg" alt="scallionpie" width="500" height="281" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-7142"/></a></p>
