It’s officially a trend - for the third month in a row, I’ve sold one copy of [Fugu Maze - The Project](http://u3d.as/content/technicat-llc/fugu-maze/1AT) on the Unity Asset Store.

I’m actually not disappointed. I was afraid the first sale in March might be a fluke. And better, it has a four-star rating (too bad the Asset Store doesn’t tell me right now how many ratings there are)

This was really my experimental foray into the Asset Store, but I think it should be a useful package (and potentially profitable - I’ve made some money off the [iOS version](http://itunes.apple.com/app/fugu-maze/id295808255?mt=8), although some additional effort went into that adaptation and the [Android version](https://market.android.com/details?id=com.technicat.FuguMaze)). You can put it together from scratch using the maze generation script I put on the wiki and Unity Standard Assets, but not everyone has an easy time doing that (it is a truism that if you offer a script to the community, someone will ask for a complete working project), and it demonstrates some common how-do-I-do-this features requested on the Unity forum, like footstep sounds, flashlight effect, and a pause menu (also on the wiki).

Now I’m thinking I should have included the project variation that displays a video texture on the maze wall (it’s trippy, especially when I used the John McCain greenscreen movie). Hmm, maybe I’ll make an update…and I always thought an Editor script version would be useful…
