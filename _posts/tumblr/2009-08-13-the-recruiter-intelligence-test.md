At some point a few years ago I finally realized that I’d wasted waaay to much time responding to recruiter emails, so I disabled the email address listed on my online resume. I figured that will at least winnow out the ones not sharp enough to click on the “Contact” link on my web site. That worked pretty well - I didn’t hear from any recruiters at all.

But recruiters love social networking tools. (And Microsoft Word - “please send your resume in word format” “can you reformat your resume in Word?” and “I don’t know how to cut-and-paste or I’m too lazy to do any semblance of work for my commission” - OK, I made up that last one). Recruiters used to invite me to join their LinkedIn network after wasting my time (one reason I’ve resisted joining LinkedIn), so I guess I shouldn’t be surprised that now I’m get messages from recruiters on Facebook. Oddly, they still say they can’t find another way to reach me. But it doesn’t look like I’ve missed anything - the message is typically some vague description of a job, usually asking me to do their job for them by referring anyone I know, and there’s at best a fifty-fifty chance of getting an acknowledgment if I bother replying that I’m not looking. I was thinking that Facebook might get ruined by scalability issues, buggy programming or obnoxious apps, but there’s a new threat in town. Recruiters.
