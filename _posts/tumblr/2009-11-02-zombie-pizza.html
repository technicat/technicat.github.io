<p>Zombies are a can&rsquo;t lose proposition in movies and games (shouldn&rsquo;t there be a Sean of the Dead game, or did I miss it?) And pizza always elicits a Pavlovian response from me (literally, I drool). I thought maybe combining the two would be unappetizing, but still, playing Zombie Pizza, the latest iPhone game from my friends at Appy, makes me hungry. (can&rsquo;t be worse than anchovies). Mmm, brains&hellip;</p>
