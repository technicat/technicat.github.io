<p>I&rsquo;m mostly satisfied with Facebook fan pages (I guess they&rsquo;re not called &ldquo;fan&quot;Â  pages anymore since that button got changed to &quot;Like&rdquo;), but the tortuous URLs bothered me - if you tell someone to visit your business or product fan page, you don&rsquo;t want to just say &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t remember all the numbers at the end of the URL, just search for it in the Facebook search box&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Now Facebook has vanity URL&rsquo;s for fan pages, although I didn&rsquo;t figure that out until just recently. I think I saw a mention on twitter, searched fruitlessly in the Facebook help section (Facebook is really good at some things, but privacy and documentation are not among them), and finally googled onto this <a href="http://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/6109/How-to-Create-a-Facebook-Page-Vanity-URL.aspx">useful article</a>. Google may be struggling to break into social networking, but they can console themselves that they provide the online help for everyone else.</p>

<p>So now I have the fan page URL&rsquo;s <a href="http://facebook.com/fugugames">http://facebook.com/fugugames</a> and <a href="http://facebook.com/hyperbowl">http://facebook.com/hyperbowl </a>set up. (a minimum number of fans is required before an alias can be registered, so my Technicat page is out of luck) Remember them!</p>
