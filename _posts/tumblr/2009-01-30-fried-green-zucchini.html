<p>When I first moved to Huntington Beach, it wasn&rsquo;t hard to find lunch for $5. I can&rsquo;t even get that at Carl&rsquo;s Jr. anymore, but there are still some good deals, like this pastrami sandwich and heap of fried zucchini from Harry&rsquo;s Cafe with a drink, for around $6. More notable - Harry&rsquo;s is one of the local establishments that serves free meals on Thanksgiving.</p>
