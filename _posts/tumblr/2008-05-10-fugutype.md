For once, I received a [Paypal](http://www.paypal.com/) email that was good news and not fraudulent - I registered my first sale of [FuguType](http://www.apple.com/downloads/dashboard/games/fugutype.html), one of my MacOSX widgets using the [Unity](http://www.unity3d.com/) web player for $.99 to a woman in Texas.

<!--more-->Like my other widgets, FuguType is a little gameplay experiment - some would categorize it as a “toy” rather than a full-fledged game. While trying out Unity, I thought the water looked pretty good, and I envisioned creating something like Camcom’s [1942](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1942_(video_game)) vertical scrolling arcade game. I also wanted to make a game that relied on typing, rationalizing that I should take advantage of platform-specific features, e.g. the keyboard. Marry, the two, and you’ve got vertically scrolling words that you have to type to shoot down.

It doesn’t feel like the structure is complete. Currently, the word-length will increase as your typing accuracy improves and decrease as you fall off, but it could use a flashier scoring indicator and splash effects, at least a splash sound. There should also be some break in the action - a “boss”, perhaps in the form of a sentence (“a quick brown fox…”) and succession to next stages, if the analog to the arcade game is maintained.

I’ve learned some things about selling Mac widgets, too. The [Apple download site](http://www.apple.com/downloads/macosx/) provides great exposure with minimal marketing effort on my part. Most widgets are free, so after perhaps 200,000 widget downloads, I’ve registered four or five sales. At $.99 per widget (I’m borrowing the [ITunes](http://www.apple.com/itunes/) model), those who do bother to pay don’t have any qualms about it - at least two of my my customers paid for the widgets without downloading and trying them out, first (possibly they didn’t realize that was an option). And since I’ve responded to two customer support emails, at $.99 per sale, you better make sure it’s obvious how to use them.
