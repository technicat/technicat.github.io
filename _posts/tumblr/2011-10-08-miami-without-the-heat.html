<p><em>Originally written on Epinions in June 2004:</em></p>

<p><strong>Out of Time</strong> looks like it wants to be <strong>Body Heat</strong> meets <strong>No Way Out</strong>. Denzel Washington gamely plays the police chief of a small Florida town near Miami who&rsquo;s fooling around with a married woman and then finds himself the most likely suspect in a double-murder. So he has to stay one step ahead of the authorities, led by his soon-to-be-divorced wife, to find out what really happened and clear his name.</p>

<p>Despite the humid scenery, the result is tepid. The entire movie revolves around Denzel, as each of the other major players engage in a contest to see who has less chemistry with him. When Chief Whitlock is not engaged in unexciting foreplay with the married Ann Harrison, he&rsquo;s exchanging glares with Chris Harrison, the man he&rsquo;s cuckolding, or bickering with his almost-ex-wife Alex. Then there&rsquo;s the requisite buddy figure, the forensic examiner who wanders around like he&rsquo;s looking for a sandwich.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s some mild suspense as Denzel is seemingly trapped in this corner and that, but it&rsquo;s hard to believe at any point that he&rsquo;s not going to get out of it. And the plot twists I waited for&hellip;didn&rsquo;t happen. Well, I did predict one predictable twist, and it turned out I had to settle for a different predictable twist (I liked mine better), followed by a silly feel-good ending. But I did appreciate the savvy use of cell phones, which does update this genre.</p>

<p>Eva Mendes is striking as Chief Whitlock&rsquo;s wife and believable as a newly-promoted detective, but Sanaa Lathan doesn&rsquo;t exhibit that something in her femme fatale character that could drag Whitlock down into so much trouble (she&rsquo;s no Kathleen Turner), and Dean Cain as her abusive husband doesn&rsquo;t seem scary or mean enough for his role, despite his football-player physique and &ldquo;caged lion&rdquo; acting. To be fair, the actors are impaired by uninspired dialogue. (&ldquo;I&rsquo;m coming&rdquo;, says Whitlock on the phone to department HQ, as he&rsquo;s fumbling around with Harrison. I mean, really.)</p>

<p>The warm Florida visuals (only marred by obviously fake night fog) and Denzel&rsquo;s smooth and steady performance make this movie palatable. Besides the director&rsquo;s commentary, the special features includes some cast interviews and making-of featurettes. The cool thing about DVD&rsquo;s is that you can wrap interesting movie-making information around an uninteresting movie, and <strong>Out of Time</strong> needs the help.</p>
