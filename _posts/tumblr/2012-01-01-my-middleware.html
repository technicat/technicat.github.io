<p>2011 was the year of middleware for me. At the beginning of the year, I was using Unity and Unity iOS, of course, plus the game center and iAd plugins from <a href="http://prime31.com/">prime31</a>. Then I started using the Etcetera plugin (initially for the photo chooser, but the web view and spinning cursor is useful, too), <a href="http://gameassets.net/">GUIKit001</a> for pause menus, <a href="http://pixelplacement.com/itween">iTween</a> (every non-trivial animation in <a href="http://hyperbowl3d.com/">HyperBowl</a> is scripted with iTween), Unity Android, OpenFeint, AdMob and Etcetera plugins for Android, <a href="http://anbsoft.com/">EZGUI</a> to replace pause menus that were showing up corrupted on Android (apparently a UnityGUI issue), the Transitions Manager from <a href="http://dftgames.com/">DFT Games</a> for an additional splash screen on all my apps, the <a href="http://www.artskillz.net/devBlog/lang/en-us/2011/02/25/artskillz-is-on-unity-asset-store/">Free Texture Pack from Artskillz</a> to add more wall textures to <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/app/fugu-maze/id295808255">Fugu Maze</a>, and the Localization Package from <a href="http://m2h.nl/">M2H Games</a>, and along with that, the <a href="http://u3d.as/content/masashi-wada/selected-u3d-japanese-font/1A4">Japanese fonts</a> from the Unity Asset Store.</p>

<p>Actually, much of the middleware packages I&rsquo;m now using are from the Asset Store (exceptions are the prime31 plugins and GUIKit001 - the latter was cheaper from their web site). There is of course the convenience of browsing and downloading into Unity, easy access to updates, I always look for good reviews (especially for packages that cost money), and I don&rsquo;t have to worry about the license (compared to all the sample projects that I probably downloaded from the Unity forum in 2008). Also, there&rsquo;s plenty of free stuff - part of my mission statement is to try out every free package!</p>
