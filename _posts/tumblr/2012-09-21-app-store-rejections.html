<p>During the spate of news about Steam&rsquo;s Greenlight, I saw some stories compare it to Apple&rsquo;s App Store, saying the latter in not curated, implying that you can pretty much publish what you want, short of illegality. This is a misconception shared by just about everyone who approaches me with an app idea, thinking it&rsquo;s a low-risk and low-cost endeavor. As Adobe and Google can attest, Apple can and will reject any app it wants to for any reason (now they have published guidelines, but they&rsquo;re general enough to allow any decision and it&rsquo;s not like they&rsquo;re bound by them, anyway).</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s a sample of rejection responses I&rsquo;ve received over the years:</p>

<p>Not enough functionality.<br/>
Too promotional.<br/>
It should be a web app.<br/>
Try HTML5.<br/>
It should be an iBook.<br/>
Less than very good.<br/>
It&rsquo;s just aggregating web content.<br/>
Not enough native functionality.<br/>
Try integrating maps.<br/>
Should use in-app purchases instead of multiple apps (they gave me a pass on that one)<br/>
Infringes on an Apple trademark, no, resembles Apple marketing material<br/>
Looks too much like the iOS version (OK, that&rsquo;s from the Mac App Store)</p>

<p>Some of these rejections were for update submissions, i.e. they rejected apps that are already on the store, so in the end, they&rsquo;re rejecting fixes. So, you never know.</p>
