<p>I still have a copy of Windows XP running, to make sure my projects still run there, and to remind myself how much worse Vista is (prettier, but slower, crashes more, and runs fewer programs).</p>

<p>So last time I booted it up and ran Windows Update, it prompted me to download and install Service Pack 3. Annoyingly, Windows Update lists updates without explanation of the contents (good practice for Windows users - install anything presented to you without question), clicking on the link for description of the update gets you a web page with more links to click on. My best guess got me a download page for the update with just an &ldquo;Overview&rdquo; that says the service pack includes all previous updates.</p>

<p>After acquiescing to the notion that Microsoft knows best, clicking Install gets you another window that shows the progress. The whole thing left quite a mess on my desktop.</p>

<p>That final popup shown in the middle tells me that after waiting fifteen minutes for the download and installation, it&rsquo;s figured out that I don&rsquo;t have enough disk space. Nice going, way to violate the user interface commandment &ldquo;Thou shalt not waste the user&rsquo;s time&rdquo;. I don&rsquo;t suppose they noticed that almost every installer performs a disk space check before anything else - it&rsquo;s actually built into installation software.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s the Software Update window on the Mac - not much to see here, because I have an easier time keeping my Mac up to date, but it&rsquo;s all in one window, progress bar, list of updates, notifications, and update descriptions.</p>

<p>Apple isn&rsquo;t better at everything, but it is better at 99% of the interface, and this is one example.</p>
