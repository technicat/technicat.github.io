[Fugu Maze 1.6](http://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=295808255&mt=8#) appeared on the App Store today, after a three-day approval process (that appears to be standard, now). Mainly, I released this update to test the latest version of the Unity iPhone engine, but also took this opportunity to throw in a couple more wall textures and add distance fog - I think that helps blend in the lighting cutoff when you have the flash light on and aiming down a corridor. Also, I cut down the accelerometer sampling frequency, which can improve the frame rate - the default is 60 samples/second, but to 10/s is enough to detect a device shake.

I see the iTunes links now go to a real web page, from which you can then go on to iTunes. Looks like it’s still in progress (notice the “By [?]”) but it does list more of a my other apps than the iTunes page does. Also, the “friendly” version of the iTunes link - [http://itunes.com/app/fugumaze](http://itunes.com/app/fugumaze) - still goes directly to iTunes, but maybe I just have to wait a while.
