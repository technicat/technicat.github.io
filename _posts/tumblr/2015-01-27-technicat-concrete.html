<p>My <a href="http://technicat.com/">technicat</a> site, like this blog, has moved to a new web host and also to a new CMS. Originally, it was on Apache Forrest for a long time, then Drupal for eight years. This time I tried Concrete5, which appears to be oriented to designers (I think a designer colleague recommended it to me), and it does look better, I think, but I had some trouble figuring out how to configure the layout. So I went ultra simple. And I call it design.<br/><br/><a href="http://itshardtofondlepenguins.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Screen-Shot-2015-01-27-at-11.26.50-AM.png"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-7113" src="http://itshardtofondlepenguins.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Screen-Shot-2015-01-27-at-11.26.50-AM-500x218.png" alt="Screen Shot 2015-01-27 at 11.26.50 AM" width="500" height="218"/></a></p>
