<p>I&rsquo;ve only watched a few, but I&rsquo;ve been a fan of Korean film since that brief intersection of time when I had paid cable and AZN was still going. But it&rsquo;s only just recently, while scavenging for free TV on my PS3, that I discovered Korean episodic drama. First I caught a few intro episodes on Crunchroll, and then while trying out a free week of Hulu Plus I discovered they have an even bigger bounty of Korean drama and once you watch episode 2, you get hooked. There&rsquo;s been a formula in the ones I&rsquo;ve seen so far. The first episode seems almost slapstick. Then the relationship stuff starts and it&rsquo;s one tear-jerking romance-crushing romance-lifting rollercoaster ride for twenty episodes. It&rsquo;s exhausting, and you want to stick your arms into the screen, grab the star-crossed protagonists and yell, what the hell&rsquo;s wrong with you people! A Breaking Bad marathon is a walk in the park by comparison. And there&rsquo;s always a love triangle, although it&rsquo;s more like a love polyhedron. And the young and chipper female protagonist who&rsquo;s a supposedly plain jane who has at least two guys pining over her, at least one of which is a mildly bad boy unable to express his feelings. Despite being a tomboy, the girl sure cries a lot (but to be fair, the guys cry, too), but has commitment issues because of her desire for independence and self-fulfillment and ends up taking a trip to Europe at the end before settling down (how come no one wants to take a trip to Canada?) There&rsquo;s a lot of texting and really good-looking food.</p>

<p>My favorite show is The First Shop of Coffee Prince. It&rsquo;s not just my favorite Korean show, it&rsquo;s one of my favorite TV shows period (I wonder how much better I&rsquo;d like it if I understood Korean).</p>
