<p>Here&rsquo;s a Unity tip - don&rsquo;t disable the wizard. A long time ago, that startup window bugged me and I disabled it, but that inconvenience is nothing compared to getting stuck with a project that won&rsquo;t load and then trying to remember the key combination that forces Unity to start up with immediately opening the last-opened project. It&rsquo;s especially important if you&rsquo;re trying out a new version of Unity and don&rsquo;t want to automatically upgrade the last-opened project (or if you&rsquo;re still switching between old and new versions of Unity like I am).</p>

<p>Do this:</p>

<p>And you&rsquo;ll see this again on every Unity startup. Much safer.</p>
