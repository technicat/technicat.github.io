<blockquote>I don&rsquo;t understand, are you being angry because I asked for a resume?  What did I do wrong?  You&rsquo;re trying to make me regret asking you for a word version.  Everyone does that.  You&rsquo;re being a jerk and not willing to compromise.  I don&rsquo;t get what your problem is.  You&rsquo;re being rude.  You don&rsquo;t respond that way to a simple request like I did something wrong.  You owe me an apology.  That was way out of line.</blockquote>
This was in response to &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not interested. Please take me off your contact list.&rdquo; Which came after &ldquo;Never mind. Thanks for your time.&rdquo;
