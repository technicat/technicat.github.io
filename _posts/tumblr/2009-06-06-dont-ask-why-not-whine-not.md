Terminators make the best door-to-door salesmen. On the Sarah Connor Chronicles, Cromartie always impressed me with his polite “Thank you for your time”. (terminators are great at ironic delivery) This occurred to me when a Time-Warner cable salesman showed up at my door in the evening and without the courtesy of stating his business proceeded to ask me who was providing my current television service and then threatened to raise my cable modem rate if I didn’t sign up for a new package. (Terminators are much more effective with threats, too) So I told the guy to go away and then sent some rambling email to Time-Warner about how a high-tech company should be embarrassed about employing such stone-age sales tactics. That visit did complete a life-cycle presentation of door-to-door sales - usually I get college-age or teen salespeople who whine like they’re asking for a raise in allowance, and it’s just that appealing - “Oh, c'mon, why not?” And then they stomp away in a huff. But recently a couple of kids from Santa Ana came by to sell something (I forget what) so they could buy soccer uniforms. The pre-teen negotiation relies on cuteness - “C'mon, pleeeease?” But I always sympathize with the accomplice who looks like he doesn’t want to be there. Just once, I’d like to see the soccer coach, band teacher, church leader, school principal or parents doing the rounds instead of pimping out the kids. But not really. The kids range from nice to obnoxious, but I wanted to punch that cable salesguy (and does no one understand the signage words “no trespassing - no soliciting”?) And I recall that whining shows up a lot among professionals, in my own experience:

- a game middleware sales rep calling me up at work and whining “why noooot?” when I said we weren’t going to use their product
- a game outsourcing VP of marketing whining “why noooot?” when I wouldn’t give him my boss’s phone number (followed by “I know we can do this project” as an argument why we should use their serivces - “I know I can” is nice for self-affirmation but not much of a business presentation)
- a potential client whining “why nooot?” when I declined to take a project (followed by “I know your point of view but you don’t know mine”, “I’m sorry you can’t understand my point of view”, and so on, which pretty much justified my initial decision)
Whining makes for a terrible sales pitch. Grow up.
