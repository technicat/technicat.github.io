<p>I thought I&rsquo;d take a refresher visit to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_trek_experience">The Star Trek Experience</a> on my next trip to Las Vegas, but when I looked for the web site, turns out it&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2008/TRAVEL/09/01/star.trek.voyage.ending.ap/index.html">shut down</a>!</p>

<p>My first and last visit was seven years ago, so I missed out on any additions related to the most recent series, Enterprise. But I recall an extensive Federation history along the walkway into the &ldquo;event&rdquo;, then a Federation officer escorted everyone into a lift to start a tour, the lights went out as the ship was attacked (during which someone grabbed my shirt from behind - I thought that was part of the act, but it turned out to be a little girl who was afraid of the dark), we ended up on the bridge where the captain explained the situation, and we were seated in a motion simulator ride during a space battle. Afterwards, I wound down by browsing the Trek accessory stores while a Klingon insulted me (I picked up a life-sized <a href="http://www.sevenofnineb.org/">Seven of Nine</a> for a friend - don&rsquo;t ask) and a Ferengi served someÂ  me some Klingon ale and a mysterious green dish at Quark&rsquo;s restaurant while muttering something about &ldquo;hoomons&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s one of the shorter YouTube snippets of the tour:</p>



<p>and one of the videos on the &ldquo;decomissioning&rdquo; ceremony:</p>
