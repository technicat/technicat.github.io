Like everyone else in a fifty mile radius of LA, I have a half-finished screenplay stashed away. But at a recent wedding, I caught up with some friends who actually finished a whole movie, [Gamers](http://www.buygamers.com/), a couple of years ago, with [real actors](http://buygamers.com/interviews.htm) like John Heard, Beverly D'Angelo and Kelly LeBrock (remember the John Hughes movie Weird Science?)

Apparently the movie is out on DVD now, and with a recent [YouTube video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rmgk09MLS-k). Nice thing about living around here - you get to meet some pretty creative and motivated people.
