<p>I don&rsquo;t know whether people assume process names are capitalized or if they just like to see them that way. Or maybe it&rsquo;s from all those James Bond stories involving SPEKTRE and SMERSH. In any case, I&rsquo;ve seen the scrum methodology listed in job postings and even training sessions listed as SCRUM, and even agile as AGILE.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s really a waste of good marketing. I&rsquo;ve met a lot of marketing people who seem to think programmers don&rsquo;t have a clue about marketing (it&rsquo;s the reasoning that I can&rsquo;t do what they do so they can&rsquo;t possibly do what I do), but scrum, agile (and don&rsquo;t forget extreme programming) were coined by software developers and cleverly impart an athletic flair to an activity involving mostly rapid typing and mouse clicking. I think they may appeal to the wannabe athletes in us, or at least the Red Bull drinkers. It&rsquo;s a contrast with the &ldquo;waterfall&rdquo; life-cycle of development - slow, steady and peaceful, but sounds pretty.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the manufacturing types have dull names like TQM and ISO 9000, but maybe they&rsquo;ve seen the light - the Six Sigma process features Black/Green/Yellow Belt certifications.</p>
