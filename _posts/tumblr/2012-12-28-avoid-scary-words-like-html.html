<p>Wordpress is getting easier and easier to use. I especially like dragging and dropping image files right into the gallery. One thing I don&rsquo;t like is that the tab for HTML entry is &ldquo;Text&rdquo;. They&rsquo;ve apparently joined the avoid-scary-technical-words school of user interface design. &ldquo;HTML&rdquo; will just confuse people, so let&rsquo;s call it &ldquo;Text&rdquo;, which will mean the opposite of &ldquo;Visual&rdquo;, setting aside that you will end up typing text in either mode. And by the way, if you type in Text mode, make sure it&rsquo;s HTML.</p>
