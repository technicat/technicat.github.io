<p>What I miss the most about Southern California isn&rsquo;t the sunshine, beach weather, fancy shopping centers or beautiful people (although I do miss all that) - it&rsquo;s the Korean food. The Bay Area has a pretty good selection of Asian food, but for completeness, you can&rsquo;t beat LA and Orange County, as attested to in one of the NoCal vs. SoCal points here:</p>
