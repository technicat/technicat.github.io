After two weeks in submission, [HyperBowl Rome](http://itunes.com/app/hyperbowlrome), the second [HyperBowl](http://hyperbowl3d.com/) lane, is now on the App Store.

For performance reasons, I removed a lot of the transparent/translucent objects but added some particle fire effects not available in the originalgame.
