This might sound lame, but I’m still updating apps to Unity 4. I just caught up with [Fugu Maze](https://itunes.apple.com/app/fugu-maze/id295808255) and [Fugu Maze Free](https://itunes.apple.com/app/fugu-maze-free/id455596850), which haven’t been updated since September. Part of the reason was, well, Unity 4, and then all of the middleware that I’ve piled on. There was a minor change in the Prime31 Etcetera plugin, which I use for the camera access, and EZGUI was giving me compile errors for a while. And it’s possible there was an Apple rejection in there somewhere, but I’ve found if you wait long enough, no one remembers why it was rejected.

And then there’s the matter of supporting the iPhone 5, which only requires uploading a screenshot. But I only remember that after submitting the app and immediately getting the we’re-waiting-for-that-screenshot email. I always take the least-correct and fastest approach - stretching the screenshot from my iPod touch. You can barely tell, the icon at the bottom is slightly squashed. Otherwise, I think it looks pretty nice, even though I’m just using vertex lighting (I should crank it up for the newer devices).
