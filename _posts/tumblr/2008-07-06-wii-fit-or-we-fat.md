Or should I say Wii phat? It is apparently the latest greatest thing since sliced bread (or the great thing since the [Wii](http://www.nintendo.com/wii)) - last time I checked, the nearby Toys R Us had a sign posted declaring the [Wii Fit](http://www.nintendo.com/wiifit/launch/?ref=) was still out of stock. (I missed their first batch by a couple of hours and ended up paying a $30 markup for a unit from the indie dealer next door. My only consolation is that they’re still out of stock, too) After diligently using the [Wii Fit](http://www.nintendo.com/wiifit/launch/?ref=) almost daily for the last two months, I’d have to say it’s everything it’s chalked up to be, except that I’ve gained several pounds. (I hope it’s muscle) It is well-designed (as typical of Nintendo) and engaging (in a typically Nintendo manner) and a surprisingly effective substitute as a trainer. Perhaps too much like a real trainer - I obey it’s authority, but it’s getting on my nerves. I could do without:

- the insults, e.g. “The Agility Test apparently isn’t your strength. Do you have trouble walking in a straight line?”
- the music - I can’t get that damn tune out of my head
- monopolizing my Wii - since I don’t want to swap discs every day, I’ve stopped playing other Wii games
- the yoga instructor - she looks OK, but for a CG character she’s rather plain (could use a [Team Ninja](http://www.tecmo.co.jp/teamninja/) makeover). And she talks and moves real slow. Or maybe that’s just yoga.
On the other hand, I got my Wii Fit age down to something approximating my real age (in contrast to my [Brain Age](http://www.brainage.com/launch/index.jsp) age, which barely got below senility), I learned a thing or two about yoga, and if my life ever depends on dressing up as a penguin and sliding around an iceberg to catch fish, or running around in a giant bubble while avoiding bees trying to pop me, I’m ready. Plus I think that yoga instructor likes me.
