Although I’ve been pretty happy checking my App Store download stats with [AppStore Clerk](http://blog.fieryferret.com/2008/10/appstore-clerk.html) (after all, it’s free), there’s nothing like a pretty graph, so I gave the demo of&nbsp;[AppViz](http://www.apple.com/downloads/macosx/development_tools/appviz.html) a try.

Here are the sales for [FuguMaze](http://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=295808255&mt=8), which I launched free, but then started charging for it after 20,000 downloads in the first week. You can pretty much tell from the graph when I started charging.

Upgrades are tallied separately - it would be nice to have a combined graph that shows all downloads.

A feature I have mixed feelings about - downloading reviews. But with some detachment, they can be entertaining, and sometimes helpful.

I’ve made one upgrade, and you can probably tell from the sales and update graphs when that happened.
