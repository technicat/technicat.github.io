Google Translate is a great way to learn Chinese characters, but when you click on the “speak” button, it only speaks Mandarin. But guess what, Mac OSX has Cantonese speech-to-text. In the System Preferences, go to the Dictation & Speech settings, and under Chinese voices add the Hong Kong voice Sin-ji, and enable the option to speak selected text by holding down the Option and ESC keys (or the key combo of your choice).

Now, whenever you have selectable Chinese text, you can hear it in Cantonese. It works great in conjunction with Google Translate - type in English, see the Chinese translation, select that translation and hear it in Cantonese (and if you’re curious, compare it to the Google Translate Mandarin pronunciation).
