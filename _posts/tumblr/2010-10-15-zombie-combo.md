You can’t go wrong with zombies. I recently picked up Appy Entertainment’s $.99 zombie app package. My only complaint is that I can’t remember the name - Zombie in a Box? All-in-one Zombie Box? Zombie Bento Box? (Wait, I should have kept that name for myself).

Turns out I had three of the included apps, already, but that still left several more that I hadn’t seen before, such as this build-our-yown-zombie-head app.
