<p>Following on the rousing success of <a href="http://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/technicat-on-software-phil-chu/1108218697">my first ebook published for the Nook</a> (three sales) via Barnes and Noble&rsquo;s PubIt! program, I uploaded the same epub file (with a slight style tweak for the book title to get it to show up on a separate page) to the Kindle Direct Publishing program, so now it&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00703SOLC/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=httptechncom-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B00703SOLC">available on Kindle devices and apps</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=httptechncom-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B00703SOLC" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important;margin:0px !important"/></p>

<p>Overall, it came out slightly better. For example, the cover fills the screen, unlike on my Nook Color (I used the Nook Color screen size, 1024x600, as my cover size, but I think something like 500x800 would have been better) As with icons for apps, the book cover is one of those annoying last minute details. I like the way this one came out, reusing the image I created using <a href="http://wordseye.com/">WordsEye</a>.</p>
