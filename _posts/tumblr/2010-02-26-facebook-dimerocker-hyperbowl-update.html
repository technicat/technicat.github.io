<p>The bad news is that the <a href="http://apps.facebook.com/hyperbowl/">HyperBowl Facebook app</a> was down much of yesterday. The good news is that it&rsquo;s back up with an updated dimeRocker-Facebook platform. I hastily rebuilt HyperBowl with the new API and uploaded it last night,Â  but I did take the time out to try out the new themes, eschewing say, the RPG themes, so previous players may notice the new look:</p>

<p><a href="http://itshardtofondlepenguins.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/Picture-23.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3209" title="Picture 23" src="http://itshardtofondlepenguins.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/Picture-23.png" alt="" width="447" height="298"/></a></p>

<p>I think that space theme blends well with the logo scene. It was about time for a HyperBowl Facebook update, anyway - I&rsquo;d updated the other HyperBowl web players with some improved GUI screens (in particular, the arcade multiplayer selection screen) and spent some time compressing audio to get the player size down (from 10MB to 7MB). Now I think it&rsquo;s time to diverge this version a bit and try out more of the dimerocker API to get some real Facebook integration, maybe by GDC (the problem is, GDC is my deadline for everything!). Stay tuned.</p>
