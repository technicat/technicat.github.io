<p>I got a nice <a href="http://www.appcraver.com/phil-chu-talks-about-developing-apps-and-unexpected-successes/">developer interview</a> published with AppCraver yesterday. It&rsquo;s my third one so far, so I&rsquo;m averaging perhaps one interview a year. It&rsquo;s one of the more fun aspects of (self) promotion, and I enjoy reading other developer interviews. As with the Game Developer postmortems, it&rsquo;s interesting to see what others do and how it turned out. So check out the other <a href="http://www.appcraver.com/ios/interviews/">AppCraver interviews</a>.</p>
