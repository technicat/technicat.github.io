Normally, I only see [Fox News](http://www.foxnews.com/) when I channel surf through, quickly as possible like driving through the bad rea of town (the only “fair and balanced” I see is the cleavage regularly displayed on [Red Eye](http://www.foxnews.com/redeye/), which, in my defense, I thought was going to be the [Wes Craven movie](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0421239/)).

But I stopped on Fox last week when I saw [Geraldine Ferraro](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geraldine_Ferraro) on [Greta Van Susteren](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greta_Van_Susteren)’s [On the Record](http://www.foxnews.com/ontherecord/). <!--more-->I’d already heard just a little bit about her controversial remarks preceding her departure from the [Clinton campaign](http://www.hillaryclinton.com/), that [Barack Obama](http://barackobama.com/) wouldn’t be in the position he’s in if he wasn’t black, and I was willing to give her the benefit of the doubt about that, given the media tendency to hype statements taken out of context. She might have been making a reasonable point. She elaborated later that she wouldn’t have been chosen as [Walter Mondale](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Mondale)’s Vice-Presidential candidate in 1984 if she wasn’t a woman. I remember offending an African-American classmate at MIT long ago when I said that filling in the race portion of his admission form probably helped - this wasn’t one of the usual diatribes against Affirmative Action, I was just pointing out that the admission office tried to boost representation of certain groups (I was one of a handful of students from Iowa, and an admission officer told me that they took my educational circumstances into account, as if I’d had to study by candlelight in a barn)

But after watching the show, it seems this is one of those cases where the individual comments sound more innocent taken out of context. Taken together as a whole, it’s a mess. In the interview, Ferraro accused Obama of sexism, but didn’t elaborate. She stated the media was sexist, but not racist. I won’t disagree with the sexism part (after all, I started this essay with a reference to cleavage), but didn’t she see the Reverend Wright sound bites played over and over? He spoke at length about tolerance and equality among religions and ethnic groups in his NAACP speech, but all you heard after that were the wacko excerpts.

She claimed elected Democrats were afraid to go against their black constituents. Now, this is an election, not an appointment based on affirmative action - doesn’t she believe voters can think for themselves? And there are far more women than blacks, so shouldn’t the marked advantage go to Hillary if it’s just a matter of blacks voting for Obama and women voting for Hillary? In fact, in the untelevised second half of the interview, Ferraro predicted that all those women offended by Obama’s treatment of Hillary (she consistently referred to Clinton as “Hillary” and Obama as “Obama”) would vote for McCain. Is she saying that Republicans have treated Hillary better? And, for that matter, Fox?

More disturbing, she claimed that Obama was not appealing to white voters, or white uneducated voters (she started of citing rural white voters, but in the second half mentioned white taxi drivers, hair dressers, etc. who she said could be her cousins - is this in New York? - with the commonality that these disgruntled voters are white and don’t have college eduations). She said it’s “not racism, it’s racial resentment”. Oh, well, it’s not “sexism”, it’s “sexual resentment”. How does that sound?

And if she’s saying poor blacks are voting for Obama and poor whites are not, then it’s not a class issue, it’s a race issue. I like McCain, I’ve got no problem with Democrats, like Lieberman, voting for him, but when Ferraro says she’s going to “take all these things into account” when voting for or against Obama, that’s pretty weaselly for someone who’s just claiming to speak her mind - I’m voting against Obama because I sympathize with poor white voters “racially resent” him, but I’m not a racist? (those last four words are invariably preceded by a racist statement)

I remember seeing Ferraro in Iowa during her Vice-Presidential campaign. It was an exciting and historic time - maybe some of what she endured has permanently embittered her, e.g. Barbara Bush calling her something that “rhymes with rich”. But now this is sad, a white woman complaining about sexism and reverse-discrimination against white people. (just go across the street from my place to the new [Brightwater](http://www.brightwaterhb.net/) housing development - sixteen beautiful model homes filled only with photos of white families) Or perhaps sadder, a legendary Democrat spouting this nonsense on Fox News. Maybe she’s looking for a job.
