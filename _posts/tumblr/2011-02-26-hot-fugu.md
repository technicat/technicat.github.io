A cool feature I just discovered in [App Annie](http://appannie.com/) is the “Featured on App Store” feature. Seeing all of my “What’s Hot” listings provides some moral support and a better sense of world geography.

Starting off with [Fugu Bowl](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/fugubowl/id297032758?mt=8), one of my lower-rated and best-selling apps (should I work for Zynga?):

[Fugu Maze](http://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/http://itunes.apple.com/app/fugu-maze/id295808255?mt=8) had a good run in Saudi Arabia:

[HyperBowl](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/hyperbowl/id344209253?mt=8) has good reviews but was never free (unlike the individual lanes below), so I’m surprised it got on any hot list:

[HyperBowl Classic](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/hyperbowl-classic/id322930268?mt=8) is probably everyone’s least favorite HyperBowl lane but still gets downloaded the most:

[HyperBowl Forest](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/hyperbowl-forest/id344753703?mt=8) is big in Pakistan? I don’t want to read too much into it, but it is the most idyllic lane. I hope people find it soothing.

[HyperBowl Rome](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/hyperbowl-rome/id335726584?mt=8) is the best reviewed of the three free lanes, but is the least “hot”. Go figure.
