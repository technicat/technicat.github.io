<p>My first car lasted about eight years and eight-eight thousand miles. I&rsquo;m still on my second car, which has lasted nearly twice as long so far, fourteen years and 150,000 miles, and it&rsquo;s still going. That&rsquo;s largely because I&rsquo;m not driving it through New England snow and salt like I did my first car, but it&rsquo;s also because I dread another trip to a car dealer. The guys who sold me my &lsquo;94 Celica haggled with me so long and with so many people they forgot what they were asking for and accidentally dropped their price $400.</p>

<p>So next time around, I may try something different, like the sales services offered by AAA or my credit union. But this service from a YCombinator startup looks interesting.</p>
