I prefer Pepsi over Coke, but it’s not a strong preference. It’s such a weak preference, in fact, that I usually order Coke because it’s easier to say.

In Hong Kong, though, I found the opposite situation. Coke is:

可口可樂

which is more or less a Cantonese phonetic version of &nbsp;"Coca Cola,“ &nbsp;pronounced something like "ho low ho loc.” And make sure each syllable is pronounced with the correct one of six Cantonese tones (or nine, depending who’s counting).

Pepsi, on the other hand is:

百事

and pronounced “batsi” (sort of rhymes with “yahtzee”).

In six months in Hong Kong, I was never able to order Coke correctly on the first try (or even the third). I was an ace at ordering Pepsi, though.
