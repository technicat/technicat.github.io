<p>I&rsquo;ve been watching Faith on Hulu Plus as one of my marathon Korean drama sessions, but I didn&rsquo;t realize until episode 19 that it&rsquo;s a current show. So now I&rsquo;m stuck anxiously awaiting each new episode. A warrior time travels to modern day to find a doctor &ldquo;from heaven&rdquo; to save the queen, in actuality kidnapping a cosmetic surgeon, and they become enmeshed in the power struggles of ancient Korea. It&rsquo;s high concept, with some excellent bad guys. The trailer is in Korean, but you can hear the doctor calling the warrior &ldquo;psycho&rdquo;.</p>
