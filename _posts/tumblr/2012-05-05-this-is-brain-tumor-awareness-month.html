<p>May is <a href="http://www.braintumor.org/get-involved/advocacy-public-policy/BTAM.html">Brain Tumor Awareness Month</a>, and I&rsquo;m more keenly aware of this than I might otherwise be, as I just attended a very moving and inspirational Celebration of Life for a friend&rsquo;s husband who passed away recently from brain cancer. His <a href="http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/orangecounty/obituary.aspx?n=gabriel-pace-mark&amp;pid=157350111">obituary</a> just gives a hint of the amazing selfless spirit he exhibited during this ordeal. Another friend is participating in a <a href="http://laf.livestrong.org/site/TR?px=1035632&amp;pg=personal&amp;fr_id=1182&amp;et=WD1LeRf_iVY3bCDOeQum-w&amp;s_tafId=1507">Livestrong ride</a> in his honor.</p>
