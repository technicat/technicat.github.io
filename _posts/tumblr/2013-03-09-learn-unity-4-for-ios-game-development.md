My upcoming book on Unity iOS is now available as an alpha on the [Apress site](http://www.apress.com/9781430248750) (and also a preorder on Amazon, which for some reason is cheaper). Actually, I think the alpha’s been available for a couple of weeks now, since it’s on page 3 of the alpha list (or they’ve been cranking them out for SXSW). Anyway, the alpha currently has five chapters in near-to-final state (behind the scenes, another three are pretty near done), the rest in various states of draft. Accompanying projects are currently in-progress on [github](http://github.com/technicat/LearnUnity).
