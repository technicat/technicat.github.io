Signing up for one of those affiliate programs has been on my checklist for a while, ever since I read a blog by Noel Llopis recommending that as a way to augment App Store sales. I think I looked into it twice, but for some reason haven’t followed through - I think there was something in the Linkshare signup that I didn’t quite like or understand.

In any case, I read Cory Doctorow’s [Context](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1616960485/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=httptechncom-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1616960485) ![](http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=httptechncom-20&l=as2&o=1&a=1616960485), recently, and saw he does the same thing in his book reviews, with Amazon’s affiliate program. It strikes me as a big dodgy (I’m not an Anglophile, but some British words are just perfect, like “bollocks”) to review books and also profit off their sales. And Amazon always has some unnecessarily weird legalese in their programs. For example, I’m not sure I’m allowed to write this blog.

However, if it’s good enough for Cory Doctorow, it’s good enough for me. And Amazon’s affiliate program does pay better than others. So let’s give it a try (and maybe it’s time I checked out that LinkShare program again) By the way, my memory of the book has faded enough that I can’t give it a thorough review, but I recall giving it 3 out of 5 stars on Goodreads. I most liked his tips on writing (write a page a day) and self-publishing, but didn’t find all the essays (or blogs) quite as interesting, always a risk in a collection like this.
