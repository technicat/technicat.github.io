Virginia Museum of Fine Arts, Richmond. National Endowment for the Arts Fund for American Art. © 2014 Ryan McGinness / Artists Rights Society (ARS), New York.</p><p>Known for his elaborate screen printed works that reference elements of illustration and graphic design, <a href="http://www.ryanmcginness.com/">Ryan McGinness</a> gives viewers insight into his creative process with his current exhibition, “Ryan McGinness: Studio Visit” at the <a href="http://virginiamoca.org/">Virginia MOCA</a> in Virginia Beach, VA, on view through April 19. A native of the area, McGinness’s early involvement in Virginia Beach’s skate culture made a lasting impact on his work. He initially started screen printing as a teenager because he was not able to afford name-brand skate apparel, and the popularity his original screen printed designs sparked his ongoing interest in the artistic medium. For “Studio Visit,” sketches and ephemera from his New York studio or on display alongside large-scale works. Take a look at some photos from the exhibition below and stay tuned for Hi-Fructose’s exhibition at the Virginia MOCA in 2016, “Turn the Page: The First Ten Years of Hi-Fructose.”</p><p>See more on <a href="http://hifructose.com/2015/02/13/on-view-ryan-mcginness-studio-visit-at-the-virginia-moca/">Hi-Fructos</a>e</p></blockquote>
