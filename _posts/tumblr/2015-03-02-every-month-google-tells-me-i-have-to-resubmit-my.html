So I&rsquo;m trying a switchover to UnityAds. I don&rsquo;t really like fullscreen ads that interrupt gameplay, but at least it&rsquo;s video and a bit more entertaining than the usual interstitial ads (I&rsquo;ve even watched a few to completion). And everything does look better without banner ads. We&rsquo;ll see how users like it. And if it brings in more revenue.</p>
