I recently declined to have HyperBowl featured in Amazon’s Free App of the Day promotion. I spent several days pondering it, decided to go with it based on a what-do-I-have-to-lose lottery player rationale, then changed my mind late at night. Quite possibly I would have gone forward with it if I’d waited until the morning (I wasn’t in the mood to cobble up yet some more promotional art), but nevertheless, I think the reasons for declining were solid:

- The email containing and explaining the agreement was labelled “Amazon Confidential”, so I’ll just limit my complaints about the agreement to the fact that it was labelled “Amazon Confidential”. Amazon seems to have a penchant for secrecy in it’s appstore policies, even more than Apple.
- The free version of HyperBowl has been downloaded around 20,000 times, generating ad revenue and possibly leading people to buy the paid version (not so much on the Android Market but I get decent sales on Amazon). Let’s say I give away 100,000 copies of the ad-free version in one day - it’s had to see how that will markedly increase my revenue.
- The arguments I’ve heard for using free-app-a-days actually could be used just as well for promoting pirated apps. Logically, I should just have links on my web site to cracked versions of my apps (free-app-every-day)
- From the Amazon forums, it seems to me mostly unknown (i.e. desperate) developers opt to participate in the free app a day promotion.
- From the Amazon forums, it seems most customers of the free app a day promotion are rather ungrateful and unlikely to help promote your app.
- This might be the worst time for me to put HyperBowl in the free app a day promotion, since over the holidays it was approved for the Kindle Fire and yet based on recent reviews I suspect it doesn’t actually work on it. As soon as I get my next Amazon payment (I had a good December), I’ll buy a Fire and check it out.
- Free customers tend to give lower ratings than paying customers and this seems to be true to an extreme on Amazon - even without the Fire, I started off with a one-star average for free HyperBowl and a five-star average for paid HyperBowl (admittedly, with a small sample size). Especially considering the Kindle issue, making paid HyperBowl free will likely kill the ratings (an issue I had on the iOS App Store when I experimented with making some paid apps temporarily free)
On the other hand, the third-party free app a day promotions I’ve seen on the iOS App Store actually charge you for the privilege, so compared to those, this is a good deal, and if I get an offer to participate in it later, maybe I’ll do it (I won’t say I’m desperate, but I’m not too proud). And you could argue that if I add in-app purchases, I can monetize it. But adding in-app purchases to a paid app just so I can monetize it by temporarily making it free? I don’t want to pass &nbsp;a threshold where I’m spending more effort thrashing around for pennies instead of &nbsp;adding real features and content.
