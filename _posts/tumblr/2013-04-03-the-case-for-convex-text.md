In principle, I have nothing against ads. And I’m not saying that just because I have a few dozen apps with banner ads. But, like Sally in When Harry Met Sally, I like my ads on the side. No paid and undisclosed promotional links. Everything in its own area in a clearly marked advertising section.

But like a Sneaky Pete, ads are encroaching into content. At first it looks harmless, nestling into a corner of the text.

And then, while no one is looking, it drifts down the column, now firmly wedged in.

Now it’s free to burrow into the bowels of the text, like an intestinal parasite.

Finally, like invading pod people, it blends in with the crowd.

At this point, it’s a barely disclosed paid promotional link. The only thing left is to remove the disclosure. We have to draw the line somewhere. I say, respect the borders of the text. Keep it convex. And stay out of my backyard!
