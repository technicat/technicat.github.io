After the giddiness of the recent earthquakes subsided, I realized the [earthquake map](http://earthquake.usgs.gov/eqcenter/recenteqsus/Maps/special/California_Nevada.php) I viewed is an excellent presentation in the mode of [Edward Tufte](http://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/),

Each square represents location, magnitude and the time span in which it occurred. Thatâ€™s efficient!
