<p>While I&rsquo;m waiting for the next issue of Game Developer Magazine, I&rsquo;ll complain a bit about the last one. It&rsquo;s not a huge complaint - I did enjoy reading the tools survey, but the question on open source usage had the usual bits the irk me.</p>

<p>So, once again, GPL is just one open source license. If it doesn&rsquo;t work for you, don&rsquo;t use it. Citing GPL as a reason not to use open source is like pointing at a commercial license with onerous conditions and then generalizing all commercial licenses as unacceptable. I use open source, but I don&rsquo;t incorporate GPL software into my games. See? It&rsquo;s that easy. In any case, chances are if you&rsquo;re interested in a GPL package, there is an alternative commercial license offered (like with MySQL), or you can negotiate one (the incorporation of Mono in Unity is an example).</p>

<p>The article mentioned patents as an issue. That may be a valid concern, but it&rsquo;s hard to tell without any further explanation. The only thing I can think of is that open source software, depending on the package, may have a lot of unvetted contributions. Then again, that&rsquo;s true of closed-source software, too. If you want to be sneaky about it, open source does make it easier for people to find patent conflicts, but then again, it&rsquo;s easier to get them fixed (whereas with closed-source, you&rsquo;re at the mercy of your vendor, if they&rsquo;re still around).</p>

<p>And be real - is there any modern game engine out there that does not have open source components? I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve ever worked with one. The question isn&rsquo;t whether to use open source or not, the question is which open source packages to use.</p>

<p>Also, that survey mentioned many developers were still supporting the first-gen iPad and the iPhone3GS. It&rsquo;s not a shocker - you don&rsquo;t have a choice. As long as Apple is still supporting their latest iOS on those devices, your app will by default be made available to them (possibly there is some trickery you can do with the required device capabilities in the Info.plist file, but at that point you&rsquo;re knocking yourself out to get around it).</p>
