<p><a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/97905.The_No_Asshole_Rule_Building_a_Civilized_Workplace_and_Surviving_One_That_Isn_t">The No Asshole Rule</a> is a refreshing break from the CEO-worshipping books on the business shelf that seem to say you need to take the good with the bad (or more evident these days, the bad with the bad). The only item I might quibble with is the origin of the alternative nomenclature, &ldquo;ass clown&rdquo;. The <a href="http://bobsutton.typepad.com/my_weblog/">author</a> mentions the phrase possibly originating with a professional wrestler or the series The Office, but I&rsquo;ve only heard it in the movie <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_Space">Office Space</a> - I seem to recall in one of the DVD commentaries an actor saying they came up with that on the spot to maintain their film rating.</p>
