This being Sunday, especially on New Year’s weekend, I planned to lie on the sofa all day watching football and reading graphic novels.&nbsp; But I checked and responded to email, checked my Facebook page and hit several Like buttons, checked all my Facebook fan pages, posted some product news, checked my twitter feed, tweeted and retweeted, checked my YouTube page, added a new book to my goodreads account, checked the Blue Mars blog, the Unity forum, and wrote this blog entry. And those were just my obligatory tasks, not the fun stuff like the iPhone/Facebook Scrabble match I’ve been playing all day or the work stuff that’s not public on the Internet, like checking the latest HyperBowl sales figures. Much as I like to think of my self as working for myself, I really work for the Internet.
