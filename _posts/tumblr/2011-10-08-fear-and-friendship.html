<p><em>Originally written on Epinions in April 2004:</em></p>

<p>The Epinions detail summary of <strong>Fear, Itself</strong> is partly incorrect. There is a woman in search of her nephew, but there is no sheriff-gone-missing that she turned to, and she does not go directly to the protagonists Paris Minton and Fearless Jones.</p>

<p>Rather, more typical with Walter Mosley&rsquo;s reluctant heroes as in his Socrates Fortlow and Easy Rawlins series, this mystery falls upon Paris and Fearless as just another set of problematic circumstances that African Americans in 1950&rsquo;s Los Angeles must overcome, and they do not so much as solve the mystery as survive it day by day. A dubious missing-persons assignment accepted by the trusting Fearless results in police and other hostiles turning up at Paris&rsquo;s doorstep in search of Fearless. Paris grudgingly attempts to help his friend but is also motivated in ways perhaps he only partly understands. The trail leading to decaying bodies, violent confrontations, and money, lots of money, possessed by the wealthy elite, black and white, who manipulate Paris and Fearless&rsquo;s world without really understanding it. And occasionally even these people, rich beyond racism, get their fingers scorched.</p>

<p><strong>Fear, Itself</strong> lacks the freshness of the first novel in this series, <strong>Fearless Jones</strong>, and the plot seems almost irrelevant toward the end, but those who&rsquo;ve read the earlier work will welcome the further development of the this unlikely pair of friends. Despite the titles, the narrator and focal character is the bookstore-owner Paris, a man more cerebral and more fearful than the dangerous yet easygoing Fearless. It&rsquo;s tempting to speculate that the author sees something of himself in Paris, at least more than the ex-convict/ex-soldier/ex-factory-worker protagonists of his other series. In <strong>Fear, Itself</strong>, Paris confronts his own capacity for greed and violence, but one constant is his love of books, and he cares for his bookstore as he would his child.</p>

<p>The other constant is Paris&rsquo;s relationship with his friend, who at first glance seems to be a copy of the Easy Rawlin&rsquo;s sociopathic friend Mouse, but we find that although Fearless has had his run-in&rsquo;s with the law and dealt his share of physical harm, his moral compass is steady. And, as a continuing lesson to Paris and perhaps the reader, Fearless exhibits a deep understanding of human nature that can&rsquo;t be gained by reading all the books in the world.</p>
