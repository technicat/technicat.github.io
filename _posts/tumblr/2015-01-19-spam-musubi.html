<p>I&rsquo;m shocked, shocked I say, that my neighborhood Whole Foods doesn&rsquo;t carry Spam. Spam has a bad rap, but not a bad wrap - try spam musubi. It&rsquo;s cholesterol&rsquo;s answer to raw fish. I first saw it in Hawaii and then noticed it in Japanese convenience stores in Southern California. Try it, and then take some Lipitor.</p>
