<p>Game Center groups are great. I can combine the leaderboards of my free and paid apps so the latter look like they have a decent number of users. Here&rsquo;s the HyperBowl Game Center leaderboard, now that I placed all the free and paid versions in one group, so HyperBowl Classic and HyperBowl both share the same Classic leaderboard, for example. The number of players for All Lanes went up from around 5,000 to over 20,000.</p>

<p>It took me a while to get HyperBowl merged into the same Game Center group as all the free lanes. Turns out, unlike the regular leaderboards, to add the aggregate leaderboard I had to manually add a group version of that leaderboard to merge with. And if you have an aggregate leaderboard, that has to mergeable before you can merge any of the leaderboards that it&rsquo;s aggregating.</p>
