In the entertainment industry, we should remind ourselves what we’re doing isn’t all that important (hey, get over yourselves!). Sure, some people create visual masterpieces and hours of enjoyment, but then again, there are those who can’t even see. That’s where [Project Prakash](http://web.mit.edu/bcs/sinha/prakash.html), started by my friend [Pawan Sinha](http://web.mit.edu/bcs/sinha/home.html) at MIT, comes in.
