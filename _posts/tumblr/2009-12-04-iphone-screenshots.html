<p>There are a couple of non-obvious ways to take iPhone screenshots. My preferred method is on the iPhone, pressing the Home and Power button simultaneously. It&rsquo;s a bit awkward, especially if you&rsquo;re in the middle of a game, and occasionally I accidently exit the game instead, but this has the advantage of letting you take snapshots at any time, sitting on the couch, whatever. And then the screenshot is in your iPhone Photo album which syncs to iPhoto.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, my iPhoto goes through periods where it won&rsquo;t start up. So for my latest app submission (the <a href="http://hyperbowl3d.com/">HyperBowl</a> Forest lane), I resorted to XCode - bring up the Organizer window, click on the connected device, select the Screenshots tab and click the Capture button to take a screenshot. The part that stymied me was how to find the screenshot on my drive. I googled through several blogs before finding <a href="http://www.2-bit-toys.com/2009/01/02/two-ways-to-take-iphone-screenshots/">one</a> that figured it out for me - they&rsquo;re in ~user/Library/Application Support/Developer/Shared/Xcode/Screenshots</p>
