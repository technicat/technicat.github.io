<p>My enjoyment in watching the US Open was marred, not for the first time, by the commentator&rsquo;s obsession of the nationalities of the individual players. John MacEnroe isn&rsquo;t too bad with this, but Dick Enberg won&rsquo;t shut up about it. During one of Federer&rsquo;s matches, I was reminded four times in one sitting that his opponent is an &ldquo;Aussie&rdquo;, and his next opponent I learned was a &ldquo;Spaniard&rdquo;, and they never fail to mention the Russian women (&ldquo;and another Russian&hellip;&rdquo;), although there was some discussion on how Sharapova was really only half Russian, and then how &ldquo;patriots&rdquo; in the stands would be rooting the for the remaining American.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not saying thisÂ  is totally irrelevant and uninteresting information, but in no other sport outside of the Olympics, not even the nationally mixed NBA or a similarly individual and international sport like golf, do I hear this kind of incessant labelling. It reminds me of the &ldquo;where are you really from&rdquo; queries I used to get a lot (not so much here in California, but, for example, in Henry Louis Gates&rsquo; city of Cambridge). Interestingly, I don&rsquo;t hear some of the top players designated by their nationalities so much, e.g. Federer - perhaps it seems disrepectful. The commentators had a chuckle over how Oudin didn&rsquo;t know about her French ancestry on her father&rsquo;s side until she was asked about it at the tennis tournament. Maybe that&rsquo;s more a comment about the tennis world.</p>
