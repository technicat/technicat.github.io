<p>Aaron Mark&rsquo;s <a href="http://filmsound.org/game-audio/gameaudiobook.htm">The Complete Guide to Game Audio </a>is one of my favorite game industry books, even though I know squat about audio (well, maybe that&rsquo;s one reason I like it). Much of the career advice is generally useful to game industry freelancers, including tips on marketing yourself. I&rsquo;ve noticed one common-sense tip on direct email marketing usually goes unheeded - do some research, find the name of the contact, and personalize the message as much as possible. I get a lot of game audio solicitations (it&rsquo;s a tough business - I&rsquo;ve only been one one game project that has used more than one audio person), and nearly all look like form letters without even addressing the name of my company.</p>

<p>So I nearly fell off my chair when I received an email that started with my name and included the name of my company. Just from that, I wanted to give the sender, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1804098/">Adgio Hutchings</a>, a contract (never mind that I&rsquo;m a one-person company making tiny games). And bonus, the attached PDF portfolio mentioned work that I&rsquo;d seen in <a href="http://www.thelot.com/">On The Lot</a>:</p>

I wish more solicitations were like this, but I don&rsquo;t really hold it against game audio professionals - I receive worse from product marketing managers who should know better. One middleware company launching a new product sent me a form email asking for meeting at GDC, and then a week later the same email, but addressed to a contact at another company and BCC&rsquo;d to me. Isn&rsquo;t a facility with email programs a minimal requirement for marketing positions? Another product manager from a telcom inquired about deploying one of my cell phone games. I asked which one? He gave a general description. But which one in particular? You can just try them all on my web site within a web browser. He repeated the same vague requirements. It was like a Turing Test in which the human failed.</p>
