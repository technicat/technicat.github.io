<p>I used to be a loyal Marriott customer, member of their rewards program, and for years, I stayed almost exclusively at Marriott hotels. Then someone called me in the evening pushing a Marriott vacation package (I think it&rsquo;s one of those time-share deals). It&rsquo;s one of those calls where after ascertaining your identity the caller plunges on into a long spiel without the courtesy of checking if you have the time or if you&rsquo;re even remotely interested. So I haven&rsquo;t been to a Marriott since (although their telemarketing department promised not to call me anymore - they actually have a telemarketing department called &ldquo;Telemarketing Department&rdquo;!)

Same thing just happened with Hilton - I stayed at an Embassy Suites in November and joined their HHonors program. Since then, I&rsquo;ve been receiving junk email from them, despite clicking on the unsubscribe links like it&rsquo;s some kind of stupid Facebook game. After checking my HHonors account to verify all my settings are &ldquo;Do Not Send&rdquo;, I sent a complaint to customer service, saying if I got one more email I was going to quit the program. Maybe they heard me, because a few hours later, I got a telemarketing call instead, pushing some vacation package to Las Vegas. It went something like this:


</p><blockquote>
&ldquo;When was the last time you were in Las Vegas?&rdquo;

&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not interested.&rdquo;

&ldquo;We have just a few Hilton Vacation packages left, and we&rsquo;d like to offer them to our HHonors members first.&rdquo;

&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to discuss this. Is there any way I can avoid getting more phone calls like this?&rdquo;

&ldquo;I can look into that. I called you because you&rsquo;re in our HHonors program.&rdquo;

&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been receiving promotional email since I joined and I don&rsquo;t want any of that or any phone calls.&rdquo;

&ldquo;Well, we called you because you&rsquo;re in our HHonors program.&rdquo;

&ldquo;Then I don&rsquo;t want to be in the HHonors program anymore.&rdquo;

&ldquo;OK.&rdquo; Click.
</blockquote>

So now I just sent a request for removal from the HHonors program. We&rsquo;ll see how that goes (I can change my email,  not sure what to do about the phone). And I&rsquo;ll add the Hilton chain of hotels to my boycott list. I was wondering why I wasn&rsquo;t in the Hilton rewards program earlier, and now I just remembered. Last time I went to the Las Vegas Hilton, I did join the program, and then spent the next several months trying to get them to stop sending me junk email. I might have fixed it by dismantling my old email address. Anyway, I lost interest in the LV Hilton after they closed The Star Trek Experience. As a Klingon might say: telemarketing has no honor.
