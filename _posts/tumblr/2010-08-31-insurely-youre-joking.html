<p>I was just reading, in Technology Review I think, about some recent semiconductor innovations that could keep Moore&rsquo;s Law chugging away, doubling the number of transistors that can be squeezed onto a chip every couple of years. I remember when I started my first job at Texas Instruments, transistor widths were getting close to a micron, and some people were saying we&rsquo;re not getting below that! Ten years later, I somehow fell back into the semi business and the state of the art was less than half a micron, and some people were still saying, they can&rsquo;t keep this up!</p>

<p>I wish I could say the same about the health insurance industry. They seem to have their own version of Moore&rsquo;s Law. I&rsquo;ve been through two insurers since I went freelance and both of them doubled my premiums every two years. If my health risk was really increasing that fast, I&rsquo;d be dead by now. I feel like taking up smoking and eating a chicken fried steak every day just to get my money&rsquo;s worth. And the letter I just received announcing the increase from Anthem Blue Cross (Wellpoint, the guys who tried it earlier this year, got yelled at, then just waited a few months to do it again), had the temerity to include the phrase &ldquo;We&rsquo;re all in this together.&rdquo; Really? Take a pay cut, then. Cut back on those corporate retreats. Return your bonus!</p>

<p>My dental insurance was a minor consolation - I paid $90 a year, no muss, no fuss, no worry about preexisting conditions. But then Delta Dental sent me a letter saying they&rsquo;re dropping my plan, and I had to choose one of two new plans. Instead of just including a signup form, perhaps with a simple checkbox to select a plan, they directed me to their web site. They did include a form which I could fill out to get them to send me information on the plans. So I did both, requested the info and after they arrived, since they still didn&rsquo;t include an enrollment form (I guess they really, really wanted me to use the web site), I went to the web site, registered a member account only to find out that you can review your account but not renew or enroll in it. Instead, you do that outside of the log in by clicking on the learn-about-plans button (apparently reviewing your benefits requires security, while changing your plan doesn&rsquo;t). When I started over on the new click path, tried to figure whether I was enrolling or renewing, since it&rsquo;s a new plan, then submitted a credit card payment, the web server hung.</p>

<p>So I took the lazy man&rsquo;s approach, waiting to get something in the mail telling me that I&rsquo;d renewed or expired my policy. I felt I&rsquo;d given it a hundred and ten percent, considering the first letter said they retained the option of automatically enrolling me in one of the new policies, anyway. But nothing arrived in the mail, and I called to find out yes, I&rsquo;m not covered anymore. Call me paranoid, but I get the feeling they really don&rsquo;t want my business.</p>
