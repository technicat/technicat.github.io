My rating: [3 of 5 stars](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1215935188)  
  
[Learning iOS for Enterprise](http://bit.ly/1ztg2q6) is the second review book I’ve received from Packt Publishing. It’s not quite as good as the previous one I reviewed (on Xamarain iOS development, as I recall). The biggest problem is the awkward writing and unpolished editing, for example a stretch of three sentences beginning with “It”, phrases like “testing for you,” and Smalltalk spelled as “small-talk.” And I have a quibble about the title: there is nothing specifically enterprise about this book. It doesn’t even mention the Apple Developer Enterprise Program. Also, this is more of an general peeve, but it seems to me “learn” or “learning” in the title is unnecessary. Of course you’re reading the book to learn. But this is also in issue with the Unity book I wrote.  
  
Enterprise aside, I do like the collection of topics. I often buy multiple books in the same area because they each cover topics the other don’t, which is pretty much unavoidable for any set of books about iOS development. I don’t think the introduction to Objective-C programming and Xcode will be digestible by beginning programmers, and the topics are more recipe-size than in-depth treatments, but this is the first book I’ve seen cover some nifty areas like exclusion paths in text views (text that can flow around areas) and the new Handoff and in iOS 8. And, while at first I was confused about the order of topics (the Activity Controller is introduced after the section on social integration), but I later appreciated they are presented in historical order, i.e., first pre-iOS 7, iOS 7, then iOS 8.
