Doons is an iPad game worth downloading. The controls are a bit flakey - I often unintentionally launched a block in the wrong direction after dragging to aim, releasing and then touching the screen to start aiming again. And the music started to sound repetitive after a few levels. But it’s a polished game, as you can see it has good art, it’s in “HD”, and it’s free! (at least when I downloaded it)
