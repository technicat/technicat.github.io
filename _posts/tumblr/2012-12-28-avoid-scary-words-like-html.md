Wordpress is getting easier and easier to use. I especially like dragging and dropping image files right into the gallery. One thing I don’t like is that the tab for HTML entry is “Text”. They’ve apparently joined the avoid-scary-technical-words school of user interface design. “HTML” will just confuse people, so let’s call it “Text”, which will mean the opposite of “Visual”, setting aside that you will end up typing text in either mode. And by the way, if you type in Text mode, make sure it’s HTML.
