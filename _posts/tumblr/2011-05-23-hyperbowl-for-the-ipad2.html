<p>This latest <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/hyperbowl/id344209253?mt=8">HyperBowl</a> update was largely an exercise in guilt relief. First of all, I finally got around to fixing an embarrassing physics bug I introduced in the previous update. I had added a pause menu and for the iOS version and to bring up the menu I made by the timer HUD element tap-sensitive by adding a collider, but I didn&rsquo;t set up my collision layers to avoid having that collider interact with the gameply. So if you bowled slowly enough (it&rsquo;s a very thin collider so you could go right through it), the ball seemed to run into an invisible wall. Just another example of unintended consequences from new features.</p>

<p>The second impetus was to justify getting that iPad2. I didn&rsquo;t even need my first iPad - it&rsquo;s great, but my lifestyle is inactive enough without lying on the sofa tweeting and web-surfing while watching TV. But I have to admit I got caught up in the frenzied search for that elusive new iPad. I spotted three sitting in a Target case, walked around for a while to think about getting one, and which one, but when I saw there were only two remaining in the case when I returned, I pulled out my Target card (5% off - that&rsquo;s more than half of the sales tax!)</p>

<p>It would have been anticlimactic and expensive just to see for myself that the iPad2 runs my apps as well as the first iPad, so I added some additional content just for the iPad2 (or rather, since I convert the master desktop &ldquo;has everything&rdquo; copy of the game to iOS, I just leave some more content in with a runtime check for the device). The iPad2 is fast, really fast. Whereas I added content for the original iPad up to the point where it (barely) ran above 30fps, the new iPad2 runs much of that at 60fps. I&rsquo;m looking forward to adding a lot more in future updates!</p>
