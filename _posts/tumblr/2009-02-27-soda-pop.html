<p>While watching Freaks and Geeks on DVD recently, all theÂ references to drinking &ldquo;pop&rdquo; brought back a bit of nostalgia for the Midwest. I just say &ldquo;soda&rdquo; now, or more often, specifically a Coke, Pepsi, or occasionally a Jarritos. I wish, just once, I&rsquo;d ordered a &ldquo;tonic&rdquo; in Boston, but never tried it. If you want to order carbonated beverages in a knowledgable manner around the country and around the world, check the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Names_for_soft_drinks">Wikipedia article</a>.</p>

<p>Coincidentally, I just found this can of Pepsi that I left in the freezer - it puts the &ldquo;pop&rdquo; in pop.</p>
