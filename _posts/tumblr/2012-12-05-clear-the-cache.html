<p>Once again, I ended up googling to perform what should be a routine operation on my Mac - clearing the cache in Safari. It turns out that you have to go into the Reset Safari dialog under the Safari menu and select &ldquo;Remove all website data&rdquo;</p>

<p><a href="http://itshardtofondlepenguins.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Screen-Shot-2012-12-05-at-3.52.07-AM.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5906" title="Screen Shot 2012-12-05 at 3.52.07 AM" src="http://itshardtofondlepenguins.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Screen-Shot-2012-12-05-at-3.52.07-AM.png" alt="" width="451" height="399"/></a></p>

<p>Apparently, someone at Apple decided us widdle ol&rsquo; Mac users are scared by strange words like &ldquo;cache&rdquo;, which is consistent with their Mac for Dummies moves like hiding the Library folder (really inconvenient when Xcode saves device screenshots there) and removing Save As from the Preview app (which has caused me to munge my original files more than once).</p>

<p>And it&rsquo;s the type of simplification that doesn&rsquo;t simplify anything. When tech support tells you try clearing your cache when your browser isn&rsquo;t displaying what you think it should be displaying, &ldquo;cache&rdquo; is nowhere to obviously be found in Safari, as opposed to any other web browser. You&rsquo;re supposed to infer &ldquo;clear cache&rdquo; from &ldquo;Remove all website data&rdquo;, which reminds me of a programmer I worked with who wrote a function called GetData and commented it as &ldquo;Gets data&rdquo;. General enough to be uninformative.</p>

<p>Actually, any browser would be improved by making the cache a more visible concept. What would really be useful is a &ldquo;clear this page&rsquo;s cache&rdquo; button right up there with the refresh button. In other words, &ldquo;really refresh&rdquo;. Even better, combine that with a visual indication whether the page is cached. Even better, make it possible to see the cache date. Expose the workings of the Internet instead of hiding it!</p>
