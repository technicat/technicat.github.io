<p>I have yet another <a href="http://hyperbowl3d.com/">HyperBowl</a>-style bowling game on the App Store, called <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/app/learn-unity/id634845779">Learn Unity</a>, since this is the game built following my book in-progress, <a href="http://learnunity4.com/">Learn Unity 4 for iOS Game Development</a>. Besides the name (maybe I should have called it something like Unity Bowl), the game is a bit odd since it uses conveniently free assets from the Unity Asset Store. That&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s bowling for barrels and the barrels sound like coins (the video game kind).</p>
