When I got my new MacBook Pro, I wasted nearly an afternoon playing with the Faces feature in iPhoto ‘09, which lets you tag faces in a photo and then tries to automatically match them with others. The user interface isn’t quite up to Apple standards - as I remember the Faces option presents itself when you import a photo, but when you go back to it later, Faces doesn’t show up on the right-click menu of a photo, you have to find the button on the bottom of the window. I tried to demo it for some friends at Siggraph and couldn’t remember how to to do it - I had to go to the Help section!

Nevertheless, once you get going, it’s fun. At first, you’re going to get a lot of seemingly-random results.

But after a few iterations, it gets pretty good. Here, the only false matches for me are with my brother and my cousin.

Lest you think that it’ll alway match Asians with Asians, here it matches my Dad with my cousin-in-law of Greek extraction.

And then sometimes it just can’t find the face at all. Here it ignored my friend Sumanth and went for some shrubbery.

And it doesn’t work with pets - I tried with my cat photos with no success. But there’s another product idea!
