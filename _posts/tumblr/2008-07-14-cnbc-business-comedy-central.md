When I started working at home several years ago, I had [CNBC](http://www.cnbc.com) turned on all day. Now, I can’t stand it, except on holidays when they rerun their specials (those are still pretty good, e.g. the one on the history of video games and the day in the life American Airlines). So, oddly, I tune in to CNBC more often on weekends and holidays than during the business week. Still, it’s interesting to watch the network throw programming out there even if the programming itself is not. When I started watching, it was an imitation of [Bloomberg](http://www.cnbc.com)’s business news channel. Then they added the “right on America and right on business” Kudlow and Company, a John MacEnroe talk show, The Apprentice with Donald Trump and then another apprentice with Martha Stewart, Mad Money, On the Money, Fast Money…you get the idea. Now, [Deal or No Deal](http://www.nbc.com/Deal_or_No_Deal/) - that’s genius. A few dozen gorgeous women carrying briefcases of cash. You can almost hear the guys’ brains switching off as they yell “No deal!” The “serious” programs do have some unintentionally hilarious moments:

- For a while, they played the song [Turning Japanese](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turning_Japanese) on every segment even remotely connected to Japan. Sometimes even some other Asian country. Guess they got their money’s worth.
- [Maria Bartiromo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maria_Bartiromo) taking apart a nervous young Wall-Streeter on her interview series.
- Maria Bartiromo lounging back with a more unbuttoned blouse while interviewing [Barry Diller](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barry_Diller) (“Oh, Barry!”, I could imagine her saying)
- Callers to the [Suze Orman](http://www.suzeorman.com/) show with maxed-out credit asking if they can afford to buy, say, a fur coat.
- Suze Orman lecturing a Star Wars fan to stop wasting money on memorabilia, and then asking who [Darth Maul](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darth_Maul) was.
- The seemingly sudden influx of newscasters who look good in tube tops.
- The really annoying new guy who repeatedly announces his indignation at attempts to reform CEO pay. I have to think he was hired just to show they’re not just hiring people who look good in tube tops.
- The Wall-Streeters (and aforementioned annoying guy) who downplayed the idea that an old-boy’s club was still a problem and then said women were getting paid less because they leave to have babies.
- The [E3](http://www.e3expo.com/) gamer interviewed by [Bill Griffeth](http://www.billgriffeth.com/) who obviously wanted to get back to his game playing.
- The Fast Money guys regressing into dirty-jock-frat-boy mode.
- [Dylan Ratigan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dylan_Ratigan) leading into a Fast Money interview of [Robert Crandall](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Crandall) by saying, let’s get the government out the airline mess and see how private enterprise can fix it. Whereupon Crandall gave a list consisting only of government actions (e.g. capping airline traffic at airports to reduce delays, investing further in Amtrak)
- During one of the repeated CNBC diatribes against ethanol subsidies (if they didn’t fawn over the rich and powerful, they might debate [T. Boone Pickens](http://www.boonepickens.com/), who’s stated support for them), the scrolling text recap at the bottom of the screen summarizing “ethanol subsidies cause starvation in Africa”
- A recent TV ad in which one CNBC newscaster described the network as “unbiased”, followed immediately by Kudlow plugging his “right on America” show (hey, did they copy that from “fair and balanced” Fox?)
- Every [Barney Frank](http://www.house.gov/frank/) interview, in which he invariable splutters impatiently at the stupidity of his interviews.
- [Melissa Francis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melissa_Francis) getting upset when she asks Barney Frank why Congress needs to help “just” the one percent of mortgage holders who, at the time, were facing foreclosure, whereupon Congressman Frank retorts that she obviously didn’t care about all those people. “How can you say I don’t care? I care!”
- Two interviewees who were supposed to take adversarial positions unifying in telling Melissa Francis the donations to her alma mater Harvard she’s so proud of are a wasted on a school with such a large endowment.
