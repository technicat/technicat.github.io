<p>Looking back, it seems I&rsquo;ve made a major career change every seven years so far. Nothing dramatic, like dropping programming in favor of gymnastics, but after my first seven years of employment in various R&amp;D environments (MIT, Texas Instruments, BBN&hellip;), I switched to commercial software. And after seven years of startups in graphics, games, mobile internet, and really boring stuff, I tried my hand at self-employment.</p>

<p>So, somewhat to my surprise, I&rsquo;ve spent the last seven years working as a consultant/contractor, and according to the pattern, I&rsquo;m due for a change. I don&rsquo;t know what it&rsquo;ll be. Maybe if I can support myself solely with iPhone apps, that&rsquo;ll count. Or maybe it&rsquo;s time to start working on that screenplay again.</p>

<p>The first career change was an easy call since the dot-com boom was just starting, and it was hard to time a departure so that you didn&rsquo;t leave at the same time as other coworkers (sorry, boss!) The second change was tougher, partly because that was the dot-com bust and it&rsquo;s hard to explain how being a consultant with no clients is different from being unemployed. But a couple of years in, I read Po Bronson&rsquo;s book, which inspired me by others&rsquo; example to consider that everyone should have at least a couple of careers in their lives, and also annoyed the heck out of me because no one likes hearing someone judge your choices, which it seemed to me Mr. Bronson indulged in frequently. Anyway here&rsquo;s my review of that book:</p>

<p><em>Written on Epinions, April 2005</em></p>

<p>Like his previous work, <strong>The Nudist on the Late  Shift</strong>, Po Bronson&rsquo;s <strong>What Should I Do with My Life: The True Story  of People Who Answered the Ultimate Question</strong> has an irresistible  title. I can&rsquo;t think of anyone who hasn&rsquo;t had a moment of doubt about  how his or her life has been spent or where it&rsquo;s going.</p>

<p>In a sense, <strong>What Should I Do with My Life</strong> doesn&rsquo;t disappoint. The  assorted stories of real people all interesting and some are compelling  - I was most moved by the lawyer who became a long-haul truck driver to  spend more time with his stepson. I found myself absorbed in the first  third of the book, reading about diverse characters such as the apparent  slacker who turned out to have a passion for improving golf equipment,  and the Hollywood exec who left to do something more worthwhile and  ended up back in the movies with renewed appreciation and skill in  scriptwriting.</p>

<p>But the book gets more irritating with the increasing mention of Mr.  Bronson own experiences. How he turned down a lucrative financial career  and turned to writing, how he put together a writer&rsquo;s commune in San  Francisco, how his dependence on his ex-wife held back his writing -  these come off as self-absorbed anecdotes. At least he exhibits some  embarrassment when describing a side business he ran at his regular  workplace without even trying to do a competent job at his paid  position.</p>

<p>Even more distracting are the author&rsquo;s conversations with and judgments  of his subjects. Despite his introductory protestations that he doesn&rsquo;t  have the answers, he seems to fancy himself a therapist and career  counselor. He&rsquo;s critical of those who flit among occupations,  maintaining that one should stay several years to make a mark. He  chastises an accomplished screenwriter for not completely disengaging  from Hollywood as originally intended.</p>

<p>No matter how well-intentioned, I find this advice as welcome as the  guidance counselors in my high school who told students what careers  they were suited for based on a standardized form. The author&rsquo;s  judgments are based on his own experiences (this isn&rsquo;t my interpretation  - he points to his own experiences each time he makes a judgment), but  the variety of paths taken in these stories should make clear that one  size doesn&rsquo;t fit all.</p>

<p>Some people are just trying to survive, some are searching for  validation, some want a career that defines their lives, and some want  jobs that allow them to live one. Mr. Bronson has performed an admirable  job in collecting these stories, but I think he&rsquo;s missed the point -  while he expects and urges people to find their calling (which is easy  for a successful writer to say), it seems to me the important thing is  the journey, not the destination.</p>
