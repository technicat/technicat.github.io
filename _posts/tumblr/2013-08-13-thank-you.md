I’ve been watching Hulu basically for two reasons: it plays on my PS3 and has a large selection of Korean drama. Some of the shows have a few days delay after their original showing, though, and some shows come and go. I was in the mood recently to watch [Thank You](http://wiki.d-addicts.com/Thank_You), again, and it was gone! But they’re all on [dramafever](http://dramafever.com/), which has an iPad app, also.

Thank You is an atypical favorite of mine - mostly I like the fun rom-coms (like My Girl) and action series (like City Hunter), while Thank You is pretty serious - it’s about a woman raising a child with AIDS (a rare subject in kdrama, while you there’s no shortage of plots involving dementia, cancer and amnesia) - but the leads are good and the kid is great. It’s got its fun moments, too.
