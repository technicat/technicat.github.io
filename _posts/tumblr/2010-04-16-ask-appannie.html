<p>I was googling around for mentions of my apps the other day and found <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/fugutilt/id295241739?mt=8">FuguTilt</a> listed on an App Store Top 500 list on <a href="http://appannie.com/">AppAnnie</a>. For the Games category. In the Action subcategory. In China. OK, it&rsquo;s pretty specific, and looks like it&rsquo;s dropped off already, but I&rsquo;ll take it.</p>

<p>Anyway, that prompted me to try out the App Annie service, which is another web-based app stats tracker and is currently in beta and thus free. I&rsquo;m pretty happy with <a href="http://appviz.com/">AppViz</a> for checking my daily sales stats, especially since it doesn&rsquo;t require a subscription fee, but it is cumbersome for tracking app rankings - I have to manually enter all the apps and specific categories and subcategories I&rsquo;m interested in, (with two subcategories and iPad support, that&rsquo;s four entries for <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/hyperbowl/id344209253?mt=8">HyperBowl</a>, not counting more general tracking like &ldquo;All Games&rdquo; and &ldquo;Top Grossing&rdquo;). The resulting graph is not too readable, either, although maybe it&rsquo;ll get more interesting as I collect more data.</p>

<p>The App Annie ranking display is much more convenient:</p>

<p>And there&rsquo;s an export-to-file button for the graph:</p>

<p>One AppViz feature it&rsquo;d be nice to have here is the display of all my app rankings in one graph. And my AppAnnie graphs are a bit sparse because it just has the latest data from the App Store. I wish I could import from my AppViz data.</p>

<p>The AppAnnie reviews display is also pretty nice. AppViz has a decent reviews display but only shows the average rating. App Annie is like the App Store in that it shows the breakdown of ratings, and a nice feel-good feature is the ability to filter the results. Here, I&rsquo;m just looking at the &ldquo;favorable&rdquo; reviews for HyperBowl.</p>
