<p>HyperBowl Classic 1.1 is now on the <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=322930268&amp;mt=8">App Store</a> after a two-week approval period (which, coincidentally?, is how long it took to get the 1.0 version approved). Waiting is always a nerve-wracking business but in the meantime I showed it to a neighbor who doesn&rsquo;t even have an iPhone and he seemed delighted with it, playing the game all the way through. So I felt a little more secure. Anyway, here is the updated App Store page:</p>

<p><a href="http://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=322930268&amp;mt=8"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2570" title="Picture 18" src="http://itshardtofondlepenguins.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/Picture-18.png" alt="Picture 18" width="654" height="680"/></a></p>

<p>I see some glitchiness in the App Store links - the top link (not displayed here) displayed as &ldquo;AppStore -&gt; Games -&gt; HyperBowl Classic&rdquo; still points a page for the 1.0 version as of this writing, but maybe that&rsquo;s one of those things that resolves itself over time (it generally takes a few hours for a newly-approved app and accompanying informational changes to fully appear on iTunes).</p>

<p>In any case, this update came just a bit later than I originally intended because I was waiting for the <a href="http://unity3d.com/">Unity</a> iPhone 1.5 update, and it was well worth the wait.Â  The engine upgrade, in particular the batching feature, and just one piece of my own custom-culling code (the water rendering is pretty expensive and not culled by another method, so I disable it until you roll past the pin area, and of course re-disable it when you roll back away) resulted in significantly improved frame rate (if you have an iPhone 3G-S, it should run great).</p>

<p>I also switched to the new blob shadow provided in Unity iPhone and switched the star background from a skybox to the iPhone-specific background shader (which isn&rsquo;t documented, yet, but it seems like the right thing to do) Besides that, I made a few fixes that apparently no one else noticed, like some collision walls not matching the visible walls on the left and right.</p>

<p>A little bit reluctantly, I built the app with iPhone SDK 3.0, so now you need iPhone OS 3.0 (or 3.1) to play it. Now that I&rsquo;m testing on 3.0, I can&rsquo;t be 100% sure it runs on anything less (on the other hand, it&rsquo;s not like I&rsquo;m testing on every variation of iPod touch and iPhone hardware), and I figure, there&rsquo;s no reason everyone can&rsquo;t update their OS at this point. OS 3.0 is free for iPhone users, and although it&rsquo;s a rip-off to charge iPod touch users, if they won&rsquo;t pay $4.99 for the upgrade, chances are they&rsquo;re not gonna pay $.99 for my app.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m trying to be conservative about adding content, since it&rsquo;s pretty easy to trigger an out-of-memory crash (it may not even be your app&rsquo;s fault, just run some memory hogs just before your app). But I did add a new logo scene, which is basically the original logo scene you see in the arcade/attraction version. Next update, I plan to add the original trophy scene that appears at the end of the game - if no one complains about out-of-memory crashes, that is.</p>
