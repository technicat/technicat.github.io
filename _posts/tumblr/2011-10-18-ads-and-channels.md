A few months ago I decided to get serious about revenue generation, or “monetization” as the cool kids say these days, (the decision-making went more like this - “oh, crap, I better make some money or I’ll have to find a job”). The first step was to embrace ads, which produced mixed results. iAds now comprises most of my iOS revenue, primarily from the [Fugu Bowl](https://market.android.com/details?id=com.technicat.FuguBowl), [HyperBowl Classic](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/hyperbowl-classic/id322930268) and [HyperBowl Rome](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/hyperbowl-rome/id335726584) apps. AdMob on my Android apps is much less lucrative - most apps generate a pittance, although [HyperBowl](https://market.android.com/details?id=com.technicat.HyperBowl) still brings in a bit. I am experimenting a little with [InnerActive](http://inner-active.com/) as&nbsp; possible alternative to [AdMob](http://admob.com/).

My other realm of exploration is other channels. Here, iOS is still the king. The App Store brings in most of my revenue and has the most polished app submission and maintenance process. In contrast, and to my surprised, the Mac App Store sucked (don’t get me started), and I’ve given up on them. Since my Android apps are dependent mostly on AdMob for revenue, the Android Market comprises a small fraction of my proceeds, although in sheer download numbers it’s comparable to the App Store. To my surprise, my second-best breadwinner is the [NOOK Color](http://www.barnesandnoble.com/c/technicat%2c-llc), even though ad-bearing apps are not allowed there - in fact, I might be making more in sales from the NOOK Color than on iOS right now.

The big loser so far is the Amazon Appstore. After reading their obnoxious developer agreement and some negative press, I’ve been avoiding them, but I decided I shouldn’t miss out on the Kindle Fire. Their submission web site actually runs pretty smoothly but the approval process is a bit haphazard (I got one rejection for having system info text on my pause menu, which they described as “gibberish”), they sent me a nice email asking me to submit apps for the Kindle Fire that I’d already submitted (and they’d rejected), and so far the sales have been zero. Zilch. Nada. But wait til the Kindle Fire is released…
