<p>Lately, I&rsquo;ve realized the work-recognition awards I&rsquo;ve received have gone down in pizzazz over the years.</p>

<p>Government agencies really know how to make a big production out of it. The <a href="http://www.stsci.edu/">Space Telescope Science Institute</a> held an annual show which included a most-valuable-employee award. One year, the entire IT group received it. Just for being on the employee rolls in the years preceding the Hubble repair mission, I received this very cool poster in the mail (two years after leaving the Institute), along with a patch flown on the Shuttle.</p>

<p><a href="http://itshardtofondlepenguins.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/sts61.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-171" title="sts61" src="http://itshardtofondlepenguins.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/sts61.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="647"/></a></p>

<p>I really didn&rsquo;t have to do too much at the Institute besides make my bosses feel like they were in charge (and I didn&rsquo;t do a good job of that), but in my next job at a defense contractor (contracting on-site at a contractor subcontracted by a contractor on a big defense project), there was real crunch time, and apparently not much money. They showed their appreciation with letters (&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a letter for your file - maybe this will do your career some good&rdquo;). I got one from my employer, one from my on-site manager (our client), and the most important-looking one from the Navy (our collective client). It has an impressive letterhead, but I wish they spelled my name right.</p>

<p>When I finally made my way to a Silicon Valley startup, I got both a plaque and letter, and (finally!) a check. Again, they misspelled my name. The plaque exemplifies Silicon Valley optimism with short attention span - it has room to list several product releases, and they gave up on it after one release. A coworker kindly filled up some space on it with a post-it note after I compared it to those employee-of-the-month awards you see on the walls of KFC.</p>

<p>Before the dot-com boom went bust, I joined a wireless internet startup, which dispensed with ceremony and just offered the prospect (false hope) of IPO riches. I still have the stock certificate hanging on my wall. At least my name is spelled correctly, again.</p>

<p>Those were the glory days. After I joined the game industry, the only project-completion rewards I heard about were at the beginning of a project (&ldquo;&hellip;everyone got bonuses on the previous project&hellip;I&rsquo;ll take care of you&hellip;but I&rsquo;m not promising anything&rdquo;). If you last til the end, you&rsquo;ll get a game credit. And your boss will want gratitude for all the late-night takeout dinners.</p>
