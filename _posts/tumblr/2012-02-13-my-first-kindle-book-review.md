After a handful of sales, the first review for [my Kindle book](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00703SOLC)&nbsp;on software development has appeared, and it’s a really complimentary one (it’s well-written, too &nbsp;- I’m a little concerned that the review has a better writing style than my book). Here are a couple of lines from it:

> You can easily imagine yourself having a drink with him at some computer show or conference, and being struck by his blunt pronouncements. But over that drink or two, you’ll come to find yourself agreeing with his style, because it’s a results-oriented style.

I think I owe him that drink or two. Thanks, Rick!
