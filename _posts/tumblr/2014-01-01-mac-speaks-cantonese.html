<p>Google Translate is a great way to learn Chinese characters, but when you click on the &ldquo;speak&rdquo; button, it only speaks Mandarin. But guess what, Mac OSX has Cantonese speech-to-text. In the System Preferences, go to the Dictation &amp; Speech settings, and under Chinese voices add the Hong Kong voice Sin-ji, and enable the option to speak selected text by holding down the Option and ESC keys (or the key combo of your choice).</p>

<p>Now, whenever you have selectable Chinese text, you can hear it in Cantonese. It works great in conjunction with Google Translate - type in English, see the Chinese translation, select that translation and hear it in Cantonese (and if you&rsquo;re curious, compare it to the Google Translate Mandarin pronunciation).</p>
