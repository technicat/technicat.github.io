Googling for “HyperBowl” turns up users of the original PC game still trying to run it and encountering problems, typically with variations of Windows introduced in the last five years or so. One intrepid user found the original support page in the [web archive](http://archive.org/), so I copied it over to the new [HyperBowl site](http://hyperbowl3d.com/) as a legacy [support page](http://hyperbowl3d.com/oldsupport.html).
