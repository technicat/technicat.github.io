It’s often said that managing programmers is like herding cats. Setting aside why anyone would want to do that, that analogy came to mind while I was sitting in my cat’s vet’s waiting room reading an article in Cat Fancy or something similar listing tips on managing multiple cats in the household.

Some of the advice clearly didn’t apply, e.g. dealing with cat pheremones. Or if there is an analogy there, I don’t want to delve into it. But some of the others sounded spot on. For example, introduce new cats slowly to avoid territorial reactions. Don’t give more treats to one cat than the others. Provide an outlet for excess physical and mental energy. Don’t allow bullying. And provide an area for basking in the sun.
