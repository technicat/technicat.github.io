This is my USPTO trademark classification for Fugu Games. Pretty straightforward, right? I just tried to cover it&rsquo;s use in any games I might want to make.
<pre>IC 009. US 021 023 026 036 038. G &amp; S: Children's educational software; Computer application software for mobile phones; Computer game programs; Computer game software; Computer graphics software; Computer hardware and computer software programs for the integration of text, audio, graphics, still image and moving pictures into an interactive delivery for multimedia applications; Downloadable computer programs featuring positionable game piece figures for use in the field of computer games.</pre>
This is from one of the trademark registrations for Candy Crush (as everyone knows by now, King has been filing a lot of trademark registrations!) Just from the scattershot reach of this one, you might get the impression they&rsquo;re not exactly filing in good faith, and the fact that it got accepted might have given King the idea that the USPTO is a pushover.
