<p>Silly me, ever since I terminated my Time-Warner cable broadband, I&rsquo;ve been searching the city for wifi hotspots without realizing that my phone has wifi tethering, i.e. can act as a wifi hotspot using its 3G connection, which is a standard feature in Android 2.2 (they beat Apple to the punch on this one). Once again, I&rsquo;m glad my Samsung Galaxy running Android 2.1 went kaput and was replaced under warranty - I know of no other way to upgrade the firmware.</p>

<p>The first thing I did was run <a href="http://speedtest.net/">Speedtest</a> with it.</p>

<p><a href="http://itshardtofondlepenguins.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Screen-shot-2011-03-18-at-12.02.48-AM.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4351" title="Screen shot 2011-03-18 at 12.02.48 AM" src="http://itshardtofondlepenguins.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Screen-shot-2011-03-18-at-12.02.48-AM.png" alt="" width="303" height="133"/></a></p>

<p>Speedtest gives it a D+ but that&rsquo;s in comparison to all broadband connections. Certainly, at 1Mb/s downloading, it&rsquo;s a fifth of the performance I had with cable broadband, but the latter was costing me $50/month while my Android data plan with T-mobile is $20. And I think the 1MB/s upload speed through my phone actually beats the upload speed I had with cable. Regular web browsing, Facebooking, etc. feels fine. Downloading iOS apps takes a while, upgrading my iPad to iOS 4.3 took over an hour. Downloading the latest XCode looks like its going to be an ordeal. But that&rsquo;s no worse (or perhaps even better) than the AT&amp;T connection I&rsquo;ve been getting at Starbucks. And I don&rsquo;t have to buy all those lattes.</p>
