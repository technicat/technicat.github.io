<p>My routine after getting back to my temporary home in Hong Kong is to hit the food court (or KFC if the food court is closed), and then load up on snacks at the grocery store named Wellcome (yes that&rsquo;s how it&rsquo;s spelled). I always grab the egg tarts when they&rsquo;re available, sometimes try something different like these super-soft chocolate cookies, and I just have to have my Haagen Daaz, which is both popular and overpriced in Hong Kong. This six-pack of tiny ice cream cups costs eight times as much as the other snacks and is about $10 US.</p>
