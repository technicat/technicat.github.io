<img src="/tumblr_files/tumblr_nor7jv4hT21tgne1po1_1280.png"/><br/><p>I just blew away the copy of my old Wordpress blog after my web hosting service complained I violated their terms of service by turning on the automatic backup option (my question: why have that option then, and why have a help article explaining how to turn it on?). All the old articles were copied into this blog (some mangled) and available on good old internet.org. It was a good run of six years. Six years!</p>
