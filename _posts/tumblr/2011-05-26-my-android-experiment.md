I’ve been thinking about when to take the Android plunge ever since Unity Android was in its first beta. After trying to come up with a business case for it, I just decided I felt like it. I mean, the big win in Unity is the cross-platform deployment, and I really wanted to see my apps on my Samsung Vibrant. And that rationale was validated - after figuring out the Android Market publication process with some AppMakr-based apps, I started with my simple iOS apps, [WordsEye Feature](https://market.android.com/details?id=com.technicat.WordsEyeFeature), the orphaned [Elektra Dance](https://market.android.com/details?id=com.technicat.ElektraDance) (due to various implicit and explicit App Store review criteria, I can’t update it on the App Store, anymore), the critically unacclaimed but highly downloaded [Fugu Bowl](https://market.android.com/details?id=com.technicat.FuguBowl) (gets me a few bucks a day in iAd revenue), then [Fugu Maze](https://market.android.com/details?id=com.technicat.FuguMaze) (sort of has a cult following) and finally [HyperBowl](https://market.android.com/details?id=com.technicat.HyperBowl) (the big one). All but HyperBowl were ported within a day each, and HyperBowl took perhaps five days, much of it spent tweaking for performance and manually converting the textures and audio that didn’t get automatically converted the way I wanted.

Developing for Android is fun. It puts the self back in self-publishing. Upload, click the publish button, boom, it’s there. You don’t have to go through anything like the Apple approval process, and even the software development pipeline is less bureaucratic - you don’t have to go through XCode.

The downside (aside from deploying an app that can’t possibly be tested on all the Android devices out there) is that it’s even harder to get people to buy Android apps than iOS apps. After seeing that Angry Birds went the all-ad route and Crazy Snowboard has over 250,000 ad-version downloads but less than 50 paid, it didn’t seem worth it to even try fielding a paid Android app, but I gave it a shot, anyway. I put Fugu Maze up for a dollar - no takers after a week, so I made it free and it quickly became my most downloaded and best reviewed app. It’s a good thing Unity provides an Admob plugin on their forum (and an even better thing that one Unity user posted step-by-step instructions on how to integrate it).

One discovery now that I’ve reluctantly embraced an ad revenue model (yuck, I don’t even like saying it), if you’re going to go that way, it’s better to design apps with that ad space in mind. I had a heck of a time shuffling UI elements around in HyperBowl to make room for a banner ad, and the front end navigation buttons are uncomfortably close to the ads.

It seems that Google almost discourages paid apps. Once you make an app free, you can’t change it back to a paid app. And unlike on the App Store, you can’t buy a paid app you put on the Android Market, so you can’t test the version that’s up there or the payment/download process. But since there’s no rule against having both free and paid versions of an Android app (Apple has been erratically clamping down on that), you can always change your mind and add a paid version. After publishing an Admob version of HyperBowl, I just really wanted to see a version without ads, so I went ahead and published an ad-free version titled [HyperBowl Pro](https://market.android.com/details?id=com.technicat.HyperBowlPro). It took little extra work (just copying the Unity project, undoing all the kludgy adjustments I’d made to accomodate ads, rename, rebuild). It’s better for screenshots and demos (it’s great to just pull out my phone and start up the app in a spontaneous demo). And I was a little surprised that I got a few sales right after I published it. Maybe I’ll go ahead and try a paid version of Fugu Maze, again.
