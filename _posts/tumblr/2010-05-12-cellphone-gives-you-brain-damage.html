<p>I&rsquo;ve refrained from reposting my more negative-toned reviews from Epinions (when you&rsquo;re on the receiving end of reviews, you start to appreciate &ldquo;Do unto others&hellip;&rdquo;), but I don&rsquo;t feel like writing anything today, and I&rsquo;ve reposted most of the positive ones. So, laziness triumphs&hellip;</p>

<p>Written: May 29 '05</p>

<p>Reading <strong>Cellphone: The Story of the World&rsquo;s Most  Mobile Medium and How  It Has Transformed Everything!</strong> is like being  on the receiving end of the most maddening and pointless conversation  you&rsquo;ve ever had:</p>

<p><em>I-have-the-last-word-in-the-argument</em> - In the preface, the author  states that he won&rsquo;t discuss the debate about cell phones causing brain  tumors, then immediately adds, &ldquo;The claims are unsupported by medical  evidence.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s like my previous boss who would say something rude,  followed by &ldquo;let&rsquo;s not discuss this anymore,&rdquo; then toss in a final  insult. Anyway, even if I were to trust a professor of media studies to  assess medical data, a book ostensibly about the cell phone&rsquo;s impact on  society should at least describe the not insignificant concern about  cell phone radiation.</p>

<p><em>the provocative and ridiculous assertion</em> - The author claims the  cellphone has had a bigger impact on the world than the Internet. Yet he  devotes much of the book to the advances of the Internet. (In fact,  much of the book is devoted to the history of telecommunications  starting with the telegraph and to non-unique aspects of the cell phone,  like the Pavlovian response to phones ringing) He asserts that the  videophone coverage in the Iraq war was completely objective, with  Geraldo Rivera&rsquo;s disclosure of his unit&rsquo;s location as an extreme example  of objectivity, while the one exception was Dr. Sanjay Gupta, who  interrupted his broadcasting to administer emergency medical treament to  a two-year old Iraqi boy.  (The author says Dr. Gupta&rsquo;s objectivity was  questioned, but doesn&rsquo;t say by who). What about Rivera&rsquo;s relentless  self-promotion - that counts as objectivity? Perhaps it&rsquo;s time for  Geraldo to start a new talk show using videophones, that would really  add some objectivity.</p>

<p><em>dumb analogies</em> - The author cites cites Stephen Jay Gould&rsquo;s  explanation of &ldquo;preadaptation&rdquo;, how evolutionary products such as  walking limbs later can transform into other functions such as wings,  then proposes that thumb-operated cell phone buttons also qualify.  That&rsquo;s ridiculous - cell phones are designed (or mis-designed) for our  digits, not the reverse. It&rsquo;s called user-interface design or human  factors engineering, but definitely not evolutionary preadapation,  unless our thumbs have started changing shape to match cell phone  buttons.</p>

<p><em>facts out of context</em> - The early laptops, circa 1983, are  described as limited by their operating system incompatibility with  CP/M, DOS and the Macintosh. Well, those three operating systems were  incompatible with each other, and there were plenty more at that time -  just about every line of computers had its own OS. (even within Apple,  there were the mutually incompatible Apple II, Apple III, Lisa and Mac  OS&rsquo;s.)</p>

<p><em>rambling</em> - the book is 256 pages, with surprisingly little  dedicated to cell phones, but snippets of just about everything media in  the twentieth century. Like postcards?</p>

<p><em>shameless self-promotion</em> - The book is filled with &ldquo;See my  book&hellip;&rdquo;, and the bibiliography section at the end of the book lists  thirteen works by the author.</p>

<p><em>annoying coined phrases</em> - The author describes anything cell  phone related as &ldquo;cellphonic&rdquo;. From now on, I&rsquo;ll call everything about  books &ldquo;bookolic&rdquo;.</p>

<p><strong>Cellphone</strong> reminds me of my stoned friends pontificating aimlessly  and circuitously over technology, society and philosophy. (At least I  hope they were stoned - broadcasting several minutes of such  interminable discourse would be a more powerful anti-drug message than a  two-second display of sizzling fried eggs). I&rsquo;ve often grumbled about  how today&rsquo;s cellphone culture contributes to short attention spans and  disconnected thought - it never occurred to me that a book about  cellphone culture could be the worst example.</p>
