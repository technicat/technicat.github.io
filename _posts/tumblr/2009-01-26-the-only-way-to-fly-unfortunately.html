<p>I hate flying partly due to the uncomfortable seats and stale air, but largely because it&rsquo;s just uncivilized. On a typical trip, chances are I&rsquo;ll see travelers cutting in line, rude TSA personnel, surly airline employees waiting for their company to merge with another airline and its own surly employees, passengers who want to exchange seats, and I just noticed recently, there are a lot of guys who don&rsquo;t wash their hands when leaving an airport bathroom (now that&rsquo;s a biological threat)</p>

<p>Occasionally, I&rsquo;ve observed behavior so bizarrely rude that it&rsquo;s entertaining. On a recent flight, a passenger across the aisle leaned over and placed her drinks on my tray table. (my first reaction - how did she get two orange juices? And then, heeey!) Then there was that lady who killed time as our plane was stuck on the tarmac by clipping her toenails. And the couple who insisted on sitting on both sides of me and then spent the entire flight passing items in front of me.</p>

<p>But I don&rsquo;t travel that much. Googling &ldquo;airline horror stories&rdquo; turns up quite a bit. My favorite (found on Yelp) - a first class passenger so incensed that coach passengers were deplaning first that he exited via the emergency slide. So I understand why those auto execs travelled by corporate jet. But really, since they were attending the same meeting, couldn&rsquo;t they have shared a ride?</p>
