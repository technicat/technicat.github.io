<p>Development-wise, my tendency is to do what I feel like doing. Marketing-wise, it&rsquo;s a combination of that plus what I see other people doing, especially if they have a game called Angry Birds. Anyway, I happened to check out a game called Cubemen and saw they&rsquo;re on Indievania, so took some time to deploy HyperBowl on it (both the <a href="http://indievania.com/games/hyperbowl-mac-edition">Mac</a> and <a href="http://ndievania.com/games/hyperbowl-windows-edition">Windows</a> versions). The web site has some nice features - a pay-what-you-want facility, integration with your facebook page, twitter feed, and blog. And it looks nice, partly because there are no ads (so I wonder how they make money?)</p>
