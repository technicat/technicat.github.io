I’m not voting as dumb as I used to. In past years, I’ve stood in line at the polling sites only to gaze without recognition on the various propositions, school board candidates and local judges on the ballot.

Now, as a mail-in voter with Internet access, there’s no excuse. Last election, I spent a lot of time googling for candidate sites. This year, I took more advantage of the[Smart Voter](http://smartvoter.org/) site.

I still used some simplistic rules in my voting. After Meg Whitman’s who-can-be-tougher-on-immigrants Republican campaign, she’s out. Similarly, though I’m no Carly Fiorina fan, I’m getting tired of hearing Barbara Boxer’s tirade against outsourcing to “China!” and “Bangalore!” (reminiscent of the Democrats’ union-appeasing Japan bashing, back when everyone was scared of Japan)

Some candidates didn’t even try, not even bothering to set up a web site or post a position statement on SmartVoter. That was the case with Rosalynd Freeman, the Democratic candidate running against Jim Silva, but still I couldn’t vote for Silva, after reading one of his editorials blaming the mortgage crisis on government policies and duplicitous homeowners and saying the banks were just doing what they’re supposed to do. And most of the local school board candidates didn’t have web sites either, but I couldn’t vote for the guy who plastered animated waving American flags all over his site (I would have overlooked the offense to web design if he’d displayed books, instead)

All in all, I didn’t feel there were any momentous choices this year (no Prop 8, no Schwarzenegger), except I did vote for Prop 19 to legalize marijuana. It’s time we stopped importing weed from Mexico and spend that money on the California crop. I’m with Senator Boxer on this one. Buy American!
