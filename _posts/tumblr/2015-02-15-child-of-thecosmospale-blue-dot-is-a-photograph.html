Without context this photograph appears to be pixelated noise surrounding a single point of bluish-white dot, seemingly an anomaly in the camera’s optics.</p><p>Proponents of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rare_Earth_hypothesis">Rare Earth hypothesis</a> would likely agree that, yes, Earth <i>is</i> an anomaly in the Universe, but the Pale Blue Dot image represents something more. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Blue_Marble">The Blue Marble</a> gave us the image of Earth as we like to see it - beautiful and peaceful as it moves through blackness of space. It is a home made for us.</p><p>The Pale Blue Dot, on the other hand, gave us the image of Earth we are afraid to see: A lonely speck of dust, utterly fragile and even insignificant. In Carl Sagan’s words: “<i>Our planet is a lonely speck in the great enveloping cosmic dark. In our obscurity, in all this vastness, there is no hint that help will come from elsewhere to save us from ourselves.</i>”</p><p>Perhaps one day our descendants would look at this image and compare it with what they’re seeing in the windows of their spaceships, straining to see where Earth is. Perhaps one day, 5 billion years from now, our distant descendants would watch in a safe distance while our Sun dies and transforms into a beautiful nebula, wistfully thinking that while Earth was forever gone, its legacy lives on.</p><p>(Watch the Pale Blue Dot segment from Cosmos: A SpaceTime Odyssey <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XH7ZRF6zNoc">here</a>.)</p></blockquote>
