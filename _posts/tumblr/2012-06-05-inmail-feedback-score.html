<p>Today I decided to go through all the recruiter messages in my LinkedIn inbox and provide a feedback score, since I noticed each sender has an &ldquo;InMail Feedback Score&rdquo;. But I couldn&rsquo;t find any way to provide a rating, so I googled for help, and now I feel deceived. While I&rsquo;ve been feeling honored to receive messages from all these 5-star rated recruiters, turns out you get five stars if you can just get nine people to not completely ignore you (that&rsquo;s what LinkedIn calls a &ldquo;positive response&rdquo;). If only getting five-star app ratings was that easy.</p>
