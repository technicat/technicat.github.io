<p>Well, I&rsquo;ve already fallen behind my blog-a-day goal for the year, but I&rsquo;m not too embarrassed to list all my writing targets (where I classify &ldquo;writing&rdquo; as any keyboard activity that doesn&rsquo;t produce code):
</p><ul><li>a blog a day</li>
	<li>a tweet an hour</li>
	<li>an app build a day</li>
	<li>a new app a month</li>
	<li>a book a year</li>
</ul>
Due to sleep and (paying) work, the tweet stat will have to be averaged, but the rest should be regular. Check with me in a year.
