Staying at the hip and trendy [Standard Hotel](http://www.standardhotels.com/los-angeles/) in downtown LA, after making the mistake of trying to swim a few laps in the rooftop pool (really an extension of the rooftop bar where LA-beautiful people hang out - swimming while inhaling cigarette smoke was probably a wash), I fell back to my usual city wanderings and tried to find a good bookstore. The closest I found was [Metropolis Books](http://www.metropolisbooksla.com/), a nice little indie store with fewer books on the shelf than I have in my home and not open past 6pm, much like the indie bookstore I found in downtown Bend, OR. To me, a proper cultural downtown should have a more impressive bookstore, like Powell’s [City of Books](http://www.powells.com/) in Portland, OR.

Assuming the Borders Express in Macy’s Plaza holds no surprises, I’d have to say LA disappoints on that score, although one could argue the huge[LA Central Library](http://www.lapl.org/central/) provides plenty of literary cred. If you go, be sure to visit the exhibits on the second floor.

But my favorite feature is the steps leading into the west entrance (where a Panda Express is conveniently located)

The library isn’t open after 6pm, either, so it looks like evening activities in downtown LA evening are split among the high-end cultural events (whatever’s playing at the [Disney Concert Hall](http://www.laphil.com/) or [Music Center](http://musiccenter.org/)) and club-hopping (when the library is closed the [Library Bar](http://librarybarla.com/) is open!).

But on my way back through the [Historic Core](http://www.lacity.org/ANGELSWALK/), I found a bit of culture that seemed right at home in LA, the [Museum of Neon Art](http://www.neonmona.org/), which I first saw profiled by [KCET](http://kcet.org/)’s terrifically loud and entertainingly informative [Huell Howser](http://www.calgold.com/):

Their lease is up, so I hope they have success in finding a new space. Or maybe they could move to Vegas.
