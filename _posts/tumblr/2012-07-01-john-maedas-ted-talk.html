<p>OK, this is the third TED talk in a row I&rsquo;ve added to this blog, but this one is from a friend of mine (bit of name-dropping here), John Maeda. I haven&rsquo;t kept in touch with him, but he was in my class at MIT and helped me get my first two jobs (another way you could put it is that he helped me get into and out of my first job) and since then he&rsquo;s gone onto great things, becoming a darling of Wired, garnering a loyal following and is now president of RISD. He also turned me onto unagi (eel) on rice, still one of my favorite dishes today.</p>
