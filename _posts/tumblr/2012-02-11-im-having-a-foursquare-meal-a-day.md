At first I thought foursquare was kind of gimmicky. Do I really care where you’re eating? (especially if it’s McDonalds) But then I saw if the tweets came with photos, then it looked interesting (that’s what I learned on Facebook - everyone appreciates a good food photo). And then I read an article in one of those tech magazines, Fast Company or whatever, about foursquare and some of the rationale, like if you see your friend checked in nearby, you can go and say hi. Which makes sense, I guess, especially if you’re in a place like New York.

Still, I didn’t consider joining foursquare until I set up [my about.me page](http://about.me/philchu) and started linking accounts. Since joining, I’ve been checking in to support my favorite local eateries, put more food photos on my Facebook wall, and I just discovered an American Express deal where I can get a $5 account credit for my first checkin at participating restaurants. So, I’m a convert (although I’m still a bit dubious about its long-term prospects, since few of my Facebook friends seem to be on it). I’m limiting myself to one checkin per day, otherwise I think that’ll just get annoying for anyone who’s friended or followed me. But now I’m on a mission to check into all the places that I know, and find new ones. So it looks like the real winners here are the restaurants.
