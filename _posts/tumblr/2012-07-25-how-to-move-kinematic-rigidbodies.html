<p>You&rsquo;ll often hear or read the advice that you should never move static colliders in Unity - always add kinematic rigidbodies to those objects. Less often, you&rsquo;ll hear or read that you should use the Rigidbody move and rotate functions instead of modifying the object transform, so that friction is properly taken into account. What isn&rsquo;t quite documented as far as I can tell is, once you go with a kinematic rigidbody, modifying its transform is actually slower, a lot slower, than moving a static collider. This I&rsquo;ve found from experience.</p>

<p>So, bottom line, if you&rsquo;re moving a collider, you should use a kinematic rigidbody, but only if you just manipulate it through the rigibody, not through the object transform.</p>
