<p>As I get older, I feel I&rsquo;m turning into one of those cranky letter writers you see in the free papers. Or maybe it&rsquo;s because I work at home. Anyway, during the past election, I was incensed by Barbara Boxer&rsquo;s appeal to racism and xenophobia when attacking Carly Fiorina&rsquo;s outsourcing decisions - if you&rsquo;re against foreign outsourcing, then fine, go ahead and object to Fiorina&rsquo;s outsourcing to Poland, and as a California senator, take a stand against Hollywood filming my favorite shows in Canada - don&rsquo;t just pop up images of foreign-language newspapers and shout &ldquo;Bangalore!&rdquo; &ldquo;China!&rdquo;.

In any case, I didn&rsquo;t expect a response, but after two months I received the following form letter which has no relevance to my complaint, unless the senator is submitting a bill on Willy Horton-style campaign ads. I checked the senator&rsquo;s web site during her campaign, and her list of policy statements did not include anything about outsourcing, or even immigration, which is odd, considering this is, after all, California. Pretty wimpy stuff. So the letter is worse than no letter, since the message I&rsquo;m getting is they didn&rsquo;t actually read my comments. Or if they did read it, they care so little or are so incompetent they sent this form letter anyway. And it took them two months to do it. Your government at work.
