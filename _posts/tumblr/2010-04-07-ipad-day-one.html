<p>This is actually the second draft of this blog article. I attempted to write the first on my iPad using the WordPress app, but it took half an hour for me to type it (or rather, type, untype, and retype every other word), and then after the app complained about one of the image formats and an incorrect password when I tried to publish it, I gave up. Safari provides a great web browsing experience on the iPad, so I might have had an easier time just using the regular Wordpress web authoring like I&rsquo;m doing now, but still, I found typing no easier than on a Blackberry, although the bigger keyboard, especially in horizontal mode, is a vast improvement over my iPod touch.</p>

<p>So at least for couch web surfing, the iPad is great. I don&rsquo;t want to wax too enthusiastic, but since it&rsquo;s sets so easily even just in one hand rests comfortably on your lap (in that sense, it&rsquo;s a real &ldquo;laptop&rdquo;, not like my first MacBook Pro which felt like it was cooking my thighs), I&rsquo;m tempted to call the iPad the hardware incarnation of the web browser. Too bad it doesn&rsquo;t do Flash.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a nice game machine, too. I&rsquo;m amaze how many developers rushed to release iPad games without testing on real hardware. I shouldn&rsquo;t throw stones, since I never tested on an iPhone 3G-S (I&rsquo;ll pay for hardware, but an AT&amp;T contract is another matter), but still, the iPad screen resolution is a whole different ball game. After strolling in as a Johnny-come-lately into the Apple Store on Monday to buy my iPad (no preordering, no waiting-in-line, is my feeble show of independence), I was pleased to see <a href="http://hyperbowl3d.com/">HyperBowl</a> and my <a href="http://fugugames.com/">Fugu Games</a> run just fine in both the 1x and 2x modes but the full-resolution apps look so much better. So much so, that, aside from my own stuff, I only retained the built-for-iPad apps. And I was surprised to see only built-for-iPad apps show up on the App Store when viewed from the iPad. Now I know why everyone was rushing out their iPad updates. I better get crackin&rsquo;.</p>
