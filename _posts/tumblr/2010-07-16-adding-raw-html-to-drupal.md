Migrating my [technicat](http://technicat.com/) web site from [Apache Forrest](http://forrest.apache.org/) to [drupal](http://drupal.org/) entails a lot of cutting and pasting of HTML, but that’s made even more laborious by the automatic line breaking in drupal. It’s easy enough to turn that off by unchecking that filter in the default input formats, but since that’s actually a useful feature when authoring new content, it’s better to just add a new input format. Here, I created a Raw HTML input format with all the filters turned off.
