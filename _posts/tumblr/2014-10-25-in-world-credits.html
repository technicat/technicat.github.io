<p>It&rsquo;s been three years since my approval as a Comic Con Professional, so now I&rsquo;m required to send in new verification materials, namely credited work in the past three years (this is a new take on publish or perish!) If you&rsquo;ve been working solely on a long or cancelled project, or didn&rsquo;t get credit, you&rsquo;re screwed.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve released a few self-published apps in the past few years, so I should be covered, but I also have this cool credit inside Playstation Home for the Emo-Ray bear battle game from Heavy Water. Too bad Home will be disappearing early next year (can&rsquo;t run it on PS4, anyway, so good thing I took this pic, however I took it).</p>
