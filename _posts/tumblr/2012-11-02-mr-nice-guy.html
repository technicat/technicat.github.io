<p>I&rsquo;m tempted to wait until the end of this series so I could title the blog No More Mr. Nice Guy, but here&rsquo;s the trailer. It&rsquo;s a bit different from the other Korean dramas I&rsquo;ve been watching - still melodramatic, but very dark - everyone&rsquo;s bad to some extent, and a lot of the mystery is how bad are they. And the acting among the leads is excellent. Dig that dead-eye stare at the end of the trailer.</p>
