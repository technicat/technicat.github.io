<p>Most of the manga I&rsquo;ve seen on the iPhone suffer from the screen size and inconvenient interfaces - I find have to zoom in to read the panels and usually I zoom into the wrong one. Not a seamless reading experience.</p>

<p>This manga version of the Wizard of Oz, on the other hand is just perfect. Perfectly readable on the iPhone screen so there&rsquo;s no control necessary except a finger-swipe to move to the next page. And it looks great!</p>
