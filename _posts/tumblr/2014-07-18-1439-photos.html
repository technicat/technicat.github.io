<p>Seems like iPhoto just started recognizing my LG G2 phone recently, whenever I plug it in to recharge or for development. So finally hit the Import button and, really, I took 1,439 photos since I got this phone last October? Well, minus whatever stock images were there in the first place. Considering I mostly take food photos, I think I&rsquo;ve been eating out too much. That G2 does have a pretty good camera, though.</p>
