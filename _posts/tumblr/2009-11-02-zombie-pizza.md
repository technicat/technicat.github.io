Zombies are a can’t lose proposition in movies and games (shouldn’t there be a Sean of the Dead game, or did I miss it?) And pizza always elicits a Pavlovian response from me (literally, I drool). I thought maybe combining the two would be unappetizing, but still, playing Zombie Pizza, the latest iPhone game from my friends at Appy, makes me hungry. (can’t be worse than anchovies). Mmm, brains…
