<p>It was already getting hard to separate the wheat from the chaff on the <a href="http://forums.unity3d.com/">Unity forums</a>, but now that Unity Indie is free, I&rsquo;m wondering whether I should even bother checking the RSS feed. But the folks at Unity have set up an <a href="http://answers.unity3d.com/">answer site</a> modeled after <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/">Stack Overflow</a>. There are some glitches and inconveniences - yet another login, you have to get a <a href="http://gravatar.com/">gravatar</a> for your avatar pic, the email notification on questions doesn&rsquo;t seem to work&hellip;but hey, it&rsquo;s beta. On the plus side, the format and encourages specific and focused questions and answers, the voting and reputation system encourages quality questions and answers, and right now it&rsquo;s like that hole-in-the-wall restaurant you&rsquo;ve discovered and the word hasn&rsquo;t gotten out to the hoi polloi, yet.</p>
