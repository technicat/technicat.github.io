Courtesy of [AppBoy](http://appboy.com/), I discovered the app developer listing [They Make Apps](http://theymakeapps.com/) last week. I added [Fugu Games](http://fugugames.com/) and it was easy and free (with an option to pay for a more prominent display). You can list your rate rate in $5k quanta up to “over $20k”. I’m relieved to see many developers aren’t listing the minimum $5k - I’m often approached by prospective clients who want an app developed without paying much or anything, and I was beginning to wonder…

I should also mention the site looks fantastic (I say enviously). Apparently standards based, as it looks fine on the iPad with just a slight glitch on the side tabs. Look Ma, no Flash!
