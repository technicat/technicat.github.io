A while ago I listed a bunch of stupid recruiter tricks, and one of the unnecessary attempts to be clever involves not asking, for whatever reason, if you’re interested in the job, but instead saying, hey, do you know anyone? For example, I receive this last week via LinkedIn:

> Congratulations on your successful career! Do you know anyone who has a strong right and left brain :\*) ? Codes in object oriented languages and is user interface centric?

It’s kind of weird, and kind of rude (and by the way, I hate that left-brain right-brain crap). It’s as if someone asked you, hey do you know someone who’s good-looking? I mean, what if I contacted this recruiter and said, hey, do you know a good recruiter? Or if I called that company’s HR department and asked, do you know any companies that are good places to work? I did reply, asking if he was asking me to find candidates for him, and he actually kept going with it, saying sure, unless you’re interested, have them contact me and please add me to your LinkedIn network. Yeah, right.
