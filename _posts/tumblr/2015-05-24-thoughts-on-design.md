My rating: [4 of 5 stars](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1286529494)  
  
This is a small book, less than a hundred pages, largely with graphics (naturally), and it starts off with fairly general pronouncements, but there’s some good stuff once it gets going, in particular some directives I haven’t seen before, like making use of repetition, and avoid choosing a font style correlated with the subject (e.g. the cliche of “chop suey” lettering). I wouldn’t say this is a must-have on your designer bookshelf, but, hey, it’s Paul Rand.
