[![](http://itshardtofondlepenguins.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/oilchess.jpg "oilchess")](http://itshardtofondlepenguins.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/oilchess.jpg)I was pleasantly surprised to find my old [chess rating](http://main.uschess.org/component/option,com_wrapper/Itemid,181/) listed on the [United States Chess Federation web site](http://www.uschess.org/), despite my memberships expiration in 1985 (fresh from my modest success on the Iowa high school circuit, I got trounced in a tournament my first month at MIT, whereupon I retired and devoted my time to failing my courses). In any case, I decided to resurrect my attempt at a software project management essay titled _Chess Lessons_. I’d started it a few years ago, but never fleshed it out as much as my other essays on [Technicat](http://www.technicat.com/), and from my web access logs it seemed most people who googled onto it were really searching for chess lessons. But now I figure, hey, that’s their problem (and Google’s). The essay could still use some work, but who knows what will catch on. The essays sat around in a not quite finished state for two years until _Seven Habits of Highly Effective Programmers_ got [Digg](http://www.digg.com/)’d, and that’s been the most popular to date. I thought _What I Learned at MIT_ was more of a gimmick, but that essay made it on Reddit. I saw recently that _It’s the User Interface, Stupid_ made a very brief appearance on [Reddit](http://www.reddit.com/) (voted off like an early-round American Idol contestant), but it seems most of the essays have a few fans - I sometimes get email (the nice thing about email responses is they’re usually positive - browsing for blog reactions is not for the thin-skinned). The essays ranked by popularity can be seen on this month’s web log listing:
