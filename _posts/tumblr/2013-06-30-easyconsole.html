<p>I started putting stuff like an FPS display option in the HyperBowl menu, largely for my own convenience, but that&rsquo;s really what a console is useful for and something I miss working on console and PC games (although the original version of <a href="http://hyperbowl3d.com/">HyperBowl </a>didn&rsquo;t have one either - I cobbled up an FPS display then by setting it as an init file option).</p>

<p>So I finally checked this off my what-I-want-to-do-instead-of-what-I-should-be-doing list and picked up EasyConsole from the Asset Store. There are several console packages, but I chose EasyConsole for is NGUI interface (also has one in UnityGUI). The NGUI prefab is a little bit out of date - missing script references when I use it with my installation of NGUI, which is the latest - and there are some SetActiveRecursively warnings, so it would be nice to have that cleaned up with Unity 4 - but overall it&rsquo;s pretty easy to use. I pared down the interface, changed the Update to just happen on callback, which is more efficient, particularly considering there&rsquo;s some string concatenation going on there, and merged it into the HyperBowl pause menu. Now you can toggle the FPS display and obtain device and graphics hardware info. Again, that&rsquo;s largely for my convenience, but who knows, maybe someone else will find it fun to play with.</p>
