<p>Over the last couple of months, I could tell the end was near - my PC would crash any time I gave it a stern look. This last crash looks permanent. On powerup I now get a &ldquo;Please insert boot disk&rdquo; message and the diagnostics say I have a RAID failure with all volumes unreadable (I ask you, now, what&rsquo;s the point of a RAID system?) Of course, I should have made a backup, but last time I tried the built-in HP backup software, it went through a stack of DVD&rsquo;s and still didn&rsquo;t complete. So my joy of buying a new PC and trying out Windows 7 will be tempered by trying to reconstruct my work environment.</p>

<p>In contrast, when my Mac crashed last year, the replacement asked me if I&rsquo;d like to plug in my Time Machine drive and restore my previous account. And it worked! The only thing I had to manually reinstall was my Unity license. To my surprise, even my Flash CS3 license was restored.</p>

<p>More recently, the Mac saved my bacon, or at least some embarrassment, with the Keychain Assistant. I lost a login that I was using for a client and really didn&rsquo;t want to bug their IT guys. But you can bring up Keychain Assistant, select the appropriate username and Show Password (it will ask you for your system password).</p>

<p>A decade ago, I&rsquo;d given up on Macs (and Apple) as too unreliable. Now, I wish I didn&rsquo;t have to use anything else.</p>
