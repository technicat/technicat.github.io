<p>A few years ago I attended a talk at the Santa Ana Digital Media Center given an executive from an online gaming company. Someone asked for his opinion on net neutrality and I was startled that he 1) didn&rsquo;t know what it was, and 2) answered anyway that it didn&rsquo;t concern him and that the free market would take care of it anyway. I&rsquo;ll just pose a simple scenario - let&rsquo;s say Time Warner cable strikes a deal to give broadband preference to a particular game, say WoW or Starcraft, or one of the games developed by a Time Warner studio, and conversely downgrades performance for your game. You&rsquo;re hosed.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s a nice quick-start graphic on net neutrality, including the latest news of Google once again stepping on and off the moral high ground.</p>
