I googled for the [ESA web site](http://theesa.com/) just now, and found it at “theesa.com”, even the top search result was the [European Space Agency.](http://esa.int/) So wouldn’t “anesa.com” be more accurate and less grandiose? (video games are cool, but c'mon, compared to space exploration?)

The ESA has most recently been in the news for its support of [SOPA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stop_Online_Piracy_Act). I’m not an expert on SOPA, and I’m not pro-piracy. It seems like no big deal until you see your own stuff pirated on some site that’s getting income from ads, claiming it’s providing a public service to “try before you buy”, yet not providing links for legitimage purchases - then its just irritating. And be honest - downloading a thousand cracked apps and then paying for a few, is not try-before-you-buy, it’s steal-then-pay-for-a-couple-so-you-can-say-you’re-not-stealing. However, among other issues, SOPA seems suspect on due process, and we have little enough of that already (I’ve been on the wrong end of a YouTube video takedown due to an anonymous complaint with no recourse to appeal…)

But as a gamasutra opinion article basically noted, the ESA an industry group, so what do you expect them to do? Nevertheless, the RIAA is ostensibly doing what it’s supposed to do, and it generates plenty of criticism, while it seems to me the ESA has gotten largely a free pass (the [IGDA](http://igda.org/) is the only game-industry organization I can think of that would counterbalance the ESA, and they’re better about taking to task industry outsiders, like Amazon).

And the ESA is not above representing itself as the champion of the invidual gamer - they run the [Video Game Voter’s network](http://http://videogamevoters.org/) which enthusiastically encourages gamers to protect their free speech rights as it pertains to games.

You’ll find nothing about SOPA on that site. At least the last line in the About page identifies the network as “sponsored” by the ESA. I don’t recall seeing that the first time I visited the site, nor any such identification at their E3 booth - I took the free t-shirt, though!
