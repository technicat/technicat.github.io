In last night’s presidential candidate debate, moderator Tom Brokaw at one point preceded a question by saying it “requires only a yes or no” answer. I don’t find long-winded campaign responses absorbing (I intermittently switched to [Two and a Half Men](http://www.cbs.com/primetime/two_and_a_half_men/)), but if we reduce the candidate positions to binary, then what’s the point of having a debate? They could fill out a survey and save two hours of TV time.

Brokaw reminded me of a manager who irritatedly insisted “yes or no” when I tried to give an informative response (she accompanied this with a foot stomp, which perhaps indicated I should respond one stop for no, two for yes). I’ve noticed management and marketing often get impatient asking for a “straight answer” from software engineers (hey, we’re not as bad as lawyers), but the short answer isn’t going to save you time. The aforementioned manager once asked me where to find a game file used for testing, stomped off when I started to explain there were additional files that needed to be included, and then came back later to ask why it wasn’t working. Imagine if more important decisions were made that way, like “Does Iraq have weapons of mass destruction? Yes or no!” Oh, wait…
