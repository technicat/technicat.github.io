<p>After tracking down a recent spike in my web traffic log, I discovered my <a href="http://www.technicat.com/writing/ui.html">user interface essay</a> was posted on <a href="http://www.reddit.com/">reddit</a>, and then voted off nearly immediately like an early-round American Idol contestant. So I guess it needs work.</p>

<p>Coincidentally, I&rsquo;ve been thinking about one example that I cited as a bad user interface in that essay - the voting machines used in my local polling station. <!--more-->They feature an unusual cursor-moving dial that reminds me of some Tektronix computers used in one of my MIT labs long, long ago - but the input device isn&rsquo;t the main problem, it&rsquo;s the interaction with the on-screen display. Sure, it&rsquo;s easy to move the cursor around, but traverses over and highlights every block of text on the screen, so everything looks clickable. It took me a while to figure out what I was supposed to really click - I&rsquo;m assuming everyone in my precinct without a computer science degree had at least as much confusion.</p>

<p>This came to mind not only due to the impending statewide election, but from the newly improved ATM machines at my bank. They were pretty easy to use, already, but now they sport a column of shortcut buttons on the left side of the screen after login that give quick access to your most frequent operations. So instead of three or four finger presses on the touch-sensitive screen to perform my usual withdrawal, now it&rsquo;s just one or two. So why can&rsquo;t voting machines be as easy to use as ATM&rsquo;s? And imagine if there were some convenient shortcuts, like vote-everyone-in-my-party, or vote-the-first-listed candidate. It wouldn&rsquo;t be great for democracy, but it sure would save time.</p>

<p>For this upcoming election, I&rsquo;ve switched to a complete different user interface - the mail-in ballot. No more standing in a long line on a hot summer day in the neighborhood church that has no air conditioning. And instead of gazing blankly at the candidate names for local judicial positions, I can responsibly google them as I fill in my ballot.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re in the OC and filling out your ballot right now, you can get started with the <a href="http://www.ocvote.org/">Orange County Registrar of Voters</a> for list of candidates and statements, and then googling on candidate names (I include the candidate position as a search term to narrow it down) will bring up various news and blog mentions and the candidate&rsquo;s web site, if there is one (and if there isn&rsquo;t, they&rsquo;re not running very hard). Be forewarned, candidate web sites are as interesting reading as the back of coupons, but, hey, democracy ain&rsquo;t easy.</p>
