<p>Converting my Unity iOS apps to Unity Android was a cinch. For most of the apps, nothing had to be changed in the scripts, and most of the asset changes were manual texture and sound format conversions for optimization.</p>

<p>This biggest pain in the neck so far has been the icons. Naturally, Android icons have to differ greatly from iOS icons - different sizes and no automatic rounding of the corners. There is a rather elaborate set of <a href="http://developer.android.com/guide/practices/ui_guidelines/icon_design_launcher.html">Android icon guidelines</a>, but the short summary is that you need a 48x48 and 72x72 version and they look best with a transparent background.</p>

<p>Fortunately, I managed to dig up a suitable graphic with transparent background for <a href="https://market.android.com/details?id=com.technicat.HyperBowl">HyperBowl</a> and <a href="https://market.android.com/details?id=com.technicat.HyperBowlPro">HyperBowl Pro</a> (I wish I&rsquo;d learned graphic design skills in school, along with home repair and contract law), but not for my other apps, yet, except a somewhat crude attempt on <a href="https://market.android.com/details?id=com.technicat.FuguBowl">Fugu Bowl</a>, and you can see the difference.</p>
