<p>A few weeks ago, I got tired of seeing my Amazon reviewer ranking somewhere below eleven million (which was pretty high if you consider I wrote maybe two reviews), so I copied all my goodreads reviews over (or I guess I could have just waited, as Amazon bought goodreads&hellip;)</p>

<p>Anyway, my reviewer ranking is up close to 200,000, and six out of nine people have rated my reviews helpful, which means three of them didn&rsquo;t like them, which typically includes authors, like the one responding below. Now, as an app and and book author, I also downvote reviews I don&rsquo;t like, when I can (although if it&rsquo;s a well thought-out critique, I try to restrain myself). But my rule is don&rsquo;t engage. Don&rsquo;t engage! </p>

<p>So I felt obligated to click the &ldquo;No&rdquo; button on &ldquo;Does this comment add to the conversation?&rdquo;  But I did feel ambivalent about it. I mean, admittedly it was a flimsy review (I would expand on it, but I really don&rsquo;t remember anything about the book except that it was surprisingly dull). And maybe he intended it to be this funny. But I don&rsquo;t remember his book being that entertaining. On the upside, he apparently read my other 87 reviews, including the one on Alexander Hamilton (why couldn&rsquo;t he mention Buffy? Was that what he meant by &ldquo;pop-crap&rdquo;?)</p>
