When you don’t rebuild your Unity web players and widgets to keep up with the latest Unity updates, weird stuff happens. I just brought up my old [Elektra Dance Mac widget](http://fugugames.com/ElektraDance11.wdgt.zip), and the lighting has…changed.

Compare this to the previous look, still on the [iPhone app](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/elektra-dance/id298043398?mt=8):

As one reviewer helpfully noted, the iPhone version looks a bit too much like the iTunes ads (at least the old ones - haven’t seen one in a while), so the accidental new old look could work. Now, if I just knew how I did it…
