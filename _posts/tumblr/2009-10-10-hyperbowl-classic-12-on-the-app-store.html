<p>After one week and five days (getting a little faster!), the latest <a href="http://itunes.com/app/hyperbowlclassic">HyperBowl Classic update</a> has been approved on the App Store.</p>

<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2666" title="IMG_0209" src="http://itshardtofondlepenguins.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/IMG_0209.png" alt="IMG_0209" width="320" height="480"/></p>

<p>Besides the new end-of-game trophy scene, this fixes that embarrassing ninth-frame spare crash bug (two words: &ldquo;global variable&rdquo;) and has improved physics - pins fall completely, ball doesn&rsquo;t get stuck in the wall.</p>

<p>That last one actually required a huge revamping - as I explained earlier in the blog entry on the <a href="http://www.apple.com/downloads/dashboard/games/hyperbowlclassic.html">widget update</a>, I first imported the HyperBowl assets into the <a href="http://unity3d.com/">Unity engine</a> using the default scale settings which for some legacy reason is 0.01, and instead of reimporting them with an adjusted scale, I scaled all the physics settings down accordingly. Which is supposed to work, but apparently doesn&rsquo;t. So I reimported and reattached everything for the widget and web player versions, and since the current version of Unity iPhone doesn&rsquo;t seem to import that version of FBX, I reconverted the desktop version of HyperBowl Classic to Unity iPhone again. Which is probably for the best, keeping the desktop and iPhone versions close, but which means I have to reapply all the iPhone optimizations again (probably missed a few - oh, well, next update&hellip;)</p>

<p>In the meantime, we&rsquo;re starting to see some decent reviews on the App Store page. Even the one-star review is actually a positive review - the user is just miffed that I updated the OS requirement to OS 3.0.</p>
