<p>Now that I&rsquo;ve got my <a href="http://technicat.com/">Technicat</a> site migrated to Drupal from Apache Forrest, which was so XHTML-strict it didn&rsquo;t allow embedding of Javascript, I decided to give Google Ads another go. Technicat.com is my highest-traffic site, so I&rsquo;m wondering if it can generate any signficant income, and I&rsquo;m also curious as to what ads will show up:

<a href="http://itshardtofondlepenguins.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/Screen-shot-2010-10-01-at-12.36.37-PM.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3847" title="Screen shot 2010-10-01 at 12.36.37 PM" src="http://itshardtofondlepenguins.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/Screen-shot-2010-10-01-at-12.36.37-PM.png" alt="" width="642" height="633"/></a>

I have to admit, I feel like a bit of a sell-out since most of the reasons I gave up on Google Ads before haven&rsquo;t changed. I don&rsquo;t mind restrained placement of ads, but still, anything with ads looks better without. With Google Ads in particular, some surprising and annoying ads can show up, including flashing banner ads. I recently happened on a pretty good blog article on Asian culture marred by an adjacent Google ad featuring Asian women looking for boyfriends or husbands. And Google still has an all-encompassing one-way indemnification clause in its Terms of Service:
</p><blockquote>Your Obligation to Indemnify. You agree to indemnify, defend and hold Google, its agents, affiliates, subsidiaries, directors, officers, employees, and applicable third parties (e.g. relevant advertisers, syndication partners, licensors, licensees, consultants and contractors) (collectively &ldquo;Indemnified Person(s)&rdquo;) harmless from and against any and all third party claims, liability, loss, and expense (including damage awards, settlement amounts, and reasonable legal fees), brought against any Indemnified Person(s), arising out of, related to or which may arise from Your use of the Program, the Property(ies), and/or Your breach of any term of this Agreement.</blockquote>
Nevertheless, I decided to go ahead a place Google Ads on all my sites (including this blog). In for a penny, in for potentially unlimited legal costs&hellip;
