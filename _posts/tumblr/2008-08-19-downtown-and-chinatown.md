I took the opportunity while attending [Siggraph](http://www.siggraph.org/s2008/) last week to look around and see what the [LA downtown bloggers](http://blogdowntown.com/) are talking about. Some highlights:

The [Disney Concert Hall](http://www.laphil.com/), designed by [Frank Gehry](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Gehry). They have free guided and self-guided tours covering three floors and the garden, but I just checked out the cool bookstore.

Some cool art outside the [Los Angeles Public Library](http://www.lapl.org/central/art_architecture.html):

and inside, several descending levels for each book section:

and finally, [Chinatown](http://chinatownla.com/), with one of the more ornate [Metro stations](http://www.metro.net/riding_metro/Chinatown%20Station.htm):
