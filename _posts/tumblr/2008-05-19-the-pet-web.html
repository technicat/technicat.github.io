<p>As you can probably tell from my posted cat photos, I have a cat. My vet recently sent me/her an <a href="http://www.sloppykisscards.com/partners/vetinsite/709/mqxhb6rgd8">e-card</a> from <a href="http://www.sloppykisscards.com/">Sloppy Kiss Cards</a>. <!--more-->It&rsquo;s interesting, a little creepy, and they seem to have the same music for every card.</p>

<p>Coincidentally, I also just heard about <a href="http://www.petentials.com/">Petentials</a>, &ldquo;the Internet for pets&rdquo;, where pets can blog and find dates!</p>

<p>Now, I like my cat. She&rsquo;s good company, I can trade cute-pet stories with colleagues to counter all the cute-kid stories from married coworkers, and, frankly, this cat is a chick magnet (way to earn your keep!) But the pet web thing is pretty weird, the owner acting as a proxy for the pet (or is the pet providing an alternative identity for the owner?). On the other hand, maybe it&rsquo;s the next part of the Web 2.0 boom. How about a <a href="http://www.secondlife.com/">Second Life</a> virtual world for pets? Now that would be cool - all those furry four-legged avatars!</p>
