I took a couple of hours off from updating apps to check out some free Unity GUI Skins, specifically the Extra GUI Skins and Necromancer GUI available on the Asset Store. I tested them with the pause menu in the Fugu Maze project also imported from the Asset Store (you can find the pause menu script by itself on the Unify wiki)

First, here’s the audio portion of the pause menu with the built-in UnityGUI skin.

To try out a different skin, I can just drag the skin to the Skin property in the pause menu (it’s the Options script attached to the main camera).

Here’s how it looks with the various skins from the Extra GUI Skins package. The buttons tend to look best, the sliders not so much, and it can benefit from resizing the menu to accomodate the button labels.

The Necromancer GUI also could benefit from some wider buttons for the option tabs, but otherwise, it looks fantastic!

To be complete, I decided to try out the skin that’s used in GUIKit001 from gameassets.net. It looks good, but really needs more room! (This is the “100%” version of the skin)
