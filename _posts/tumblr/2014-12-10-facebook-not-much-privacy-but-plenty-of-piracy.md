I spotted the (supposedly) paid version of HyperBowl on one of the many “free apk” pages on Facebook, so I clicked on the “intellectual property” selection in the Report this Page option. I don’t know why they bother even listing it, since this is all they offer (they don’t even bother hiding under the DMCA like everyone else).
