<p>I barely managed to get HyperBowl 2.1 submitted to the App Store just before Thanksgiving, so I could spend the holiday eating instead of working. Not surprisingly, that added a few days to the typical approval period, so it didn&rsquo;t show up on the App Store until yesterday.</p>

<p>This release includes the sixth and final lane, Tokyo. It&rsquo;s also the hugest lane, so like San Francisco, it only runs on HD devices (it&rsquo;s pretty, but not running at 5fps on a 2nd-gen iPod touch)</p>

<p>This version also supports Game Center on the iPad, as long as you&rsquo;re running iOS 4.2. I wonder if this explains the recent increase in HyperBowl players on the Game Center leaderboards. For a while it was stuck at seven, but in the last few days, there have been a few new ones each day. Next update - achievements!</p>
