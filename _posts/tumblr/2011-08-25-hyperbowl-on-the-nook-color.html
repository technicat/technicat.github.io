<p><a href="http://search.barnesandnoble.com/HyperBowl/Technicat-LLC/e/2940043856555">HyperBowl has been on the NOOK Color</a> now for about a week, and so far it&rsquo;s selling about as well as the iOS version, which means it&rsquo;s by far my best-selling Android version of <a href="http://hyperbowl3d.com/">HyperBowl</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://itshardtofondlepenguins.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Screen-shot-2011-08-25-at-5.40.36-AM.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4743" title="Screen shot 2011-08-25 at 5.40.36 AM" src="http://itshardtofondlepenguins.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Screen-shot-2011-08-25-at-5.40.36-AM.png" alt="" width="699" height="260"/></a></p>

<p>I was actually a bit tardy in getting on the NOOK bandwagon. I&rsquo;ve had a NOOK Color for a few months now and registered on the <a href="http://nookdeveloper.barnesandnoble.com/">developer site</a>, but didn&rsquo;t apply to be a qualified developer until I received an invitation to a developer networking meeting at the Barnes and Noble at <a href="http://www.thegrovela.com/">The Grove</a> in LA. So I quickly applied, got accepted, and knocked out a version of HyperBowl somewhat tailored for the NOOK Color (adjusted for the screen size, native texture format, etc.) before the meeting. I&rsquo;d hoped to have it approved by the meeting, but after getting rejected on one technicality it got approved a few days later, and now I just got an update approved, so I&rsquo;m getting the hang of it.</p>

<p>Overall, I&rsquo;m pretty impressed with the developer program. I already liked the NOOK Color - it&rsquo;s a great device and the in-store support at the local B&amp;N&rsquo;s is reminiscent of the Apple Store, and the developer meeting reminds me of the early days of iOS dev when I attended an Apple tech talk in LA, except this meeting at the B&amp;N involved some pretty good free drinks and food. Which was welcome since I decided to spend a couple of days in the area only to find the local diners in that area (I guess it&rsquo;s considered West Hollywood?) charge $10 for a burger.</p>

<p><a href="http://itshardtofondlepenguins.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/2011-08-04-14.06.05.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4744" title="SAMSUNG" src="http://itshardtofondlepenguins.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/2011-08-04-14.06.05.jpg" alt="" width="553" height="415"/></a></p>

<p>Another thing about the diners - seems like the waiters all look like the next David Boreanaz and despite the heat and humidity, exceptionally good-looking women eschew the air conditioning and sit outside in the patio. My theory is that they&rsquo;re trying to get &ldquo;discovered&rdquo; - this explains all the DVD commentaries where the filmmakers say they just happened to &ldquo;find&rdquo; an actress sitting outside of a restaurant.</p>

<p>Anyway back to the dev meeting (and Planet Earth). I only stayed for an hour since I get a little claustrophobic in crowds and I wanted to check out the adjacent <a href="http://www.farmersmarketla.com/">Farmers Market</a>, but I do like to meet other game developers - it&rsquo;s always helpful and interesting to hear their experiences and see what they&rsquo;re doing in terms of biz dev and marketing, collaboration, what tools they&rsquo;re using, and generally they tend to be cool people. Here I met someone I recognized from twitter, Ron Alpert of <a href="http://headcasegames.com/">Headcase Games</a> and had a pretty good conversation. I downloaded his game 180 on iOS and the NOOK Color - it&rsquo;s a good-looking game!</p>
