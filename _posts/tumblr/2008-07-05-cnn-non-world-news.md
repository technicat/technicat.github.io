It was old news by then, but late last evening I caught a CNN “breaking news” interruption announcing the video footage of the Colombian hostage rescue operation. Basically, three sentences:

1. Three American hostages rescued.
2. That is, three American hostages, plus the Colombian-French citizen Ingrid Betancourt
3. News at 11
No mention of the eleven other hostages, some of who’ve been held in captivity ten years. The [CNN web site](http://www.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/americas/07/05/farc.americans/index.html) isn’t much better - in a full page of stories, only one line mentions that there were other hostages - you have to click on a link leading to “world news” to read about the others. Nice bit of catering to American self-absorption on the Fourth of July. This is why I watch the [BBC](http://www.bbc.co.uk/) news on [PBS](http://www.pbs.org/).
