I was miffed enough about Goodread’s revised terms of servce, particularly the expanded indemfnification clause, that I sent them a complaint. After a few days, I received a reply:

> Thanks very much for contacting us with that question.&nbsp; Let me first say that I understand your concern, and that we debated with this exact point when creating the terms.&nbsp; Our lawyers recommended it however, and it is standard practice for free media sites to have a general indemnification clause.&nbsp; Sites like Facebook, MySpace, Flixster, and many more all have similar clauses.&nbsp; However I recognize that the “me too” excuse is not a good one.&nbsp; We honestly could have gone either way on the clause, but felt it was better to be safe and have our users trust our judgement should any unforeseen legal issues arise.&nbsp; Just as we have a reputation to uphold in the way we do business, so we have a reputation to upload in the way we treat our members - and that includes doing the right thing in any legal matters. I hope this addresses your concerns, and feel free to respond - we have core belief in listening to feedback from members.

I appreciate getting a response, but (as I in turn responded to them), “trust us” isn’t much better than “me too”,&nbsp; and there are sites that have narrower or even no indemnfication clause, including Twitter, Facebook (despite what they said), Travelocity… It is hard to completely avoid these terms - Google uses them - but I like to mount feeble protests when I can, and my usage of Goodreads is pretty weak (I just use it to track the books I’ve read and rate them - I don’t bother writing reviews). So, looks like it’s goodbye, Goodreads…
