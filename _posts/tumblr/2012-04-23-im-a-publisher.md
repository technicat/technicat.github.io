Last week I issued my first revenue share check to an app developer partner. It was a really small check (I could have just bought him lunch instead) but I feel it was a milestone of sorts - now I feel like a publisher.

Of course, I’ve been self-publishing apps (and one book) for a while, and I usually refer to myself as a developer, software developer, game developer, indie developer…but the term “developer” is so vague. It’s like calling myself a worker. Except it’s understood workers get paid for their work. Developers get invited to work on other people’s projects for fun. “Developer” is not a useful title when it comes time to describe your business model, if that business model involves making money (or to sound less greedy, making a living).

So more and more when I’ve been contacted about working on a project, I explain that either I get paid for the work or I get to publish the work. In other words, I’m a contractor or a publisher. If you want me to work on your project, I’m a contractor, I expect to get paid, and if you want me to work cheap or at some risk (like a fixed-price project), you have some convincing to do. Alternatively, if you’re proposing a project that I can publish, where no one is paying the other, you have to convince me that we can get a project done in a timely and not-too-costly manner, everyone owns what they contributed, and we agree on an equitable revenue share, based on the contribution. And if you’re just contributing an idea…let’s go back to the contracting mode and you can pay me to fulfill your vision.
