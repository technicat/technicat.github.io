<p>In <a href="http://www.wonderlandblog.com/wonderland/2010/04/a-long-way-to-go-.html">A Long Way to Go</a>, Alice Taylor laments the lack of women listed in Gamasutra&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/4323/the_game_developer_50.php">The Game Developer 50</a>, provides a number of women who could have been included, and suggests splitting the format into 25 men and 25 women. That last idea is an example of going a step too far (although featuring a Top 50 Women list is not a bad idea - then we can debate whether any of them should be in the global Top 50). But it shouldn&rsquo;t detract from the basic point. Why no women?</p>

<p>To find out why, you really just need to look at the responses, particularly from Gamasutra. We-profile-women-in-other-features is like saying we gave a woman director an Oscar, so everything&rsquo;s fine in Hollywood. And the defense that those honored were selected specifically for accomplishments last year sounds like a last-minute defense picked out of the air - the inclusion of Jason Della Rocca is essentially a lifetime achievement award (unless they&rsquo;re rewarding him for stepping down) And then there&rsquo;s the usual capper - we-work-with-a-lot-of-women-so-we&rsquo;re-clearly-not-prejudiced. That&rsquo;s like saying &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not prejudiced, some of my best friends are&hellip;&rdquo;</p>

<p>The only way to solve the problem is to admit the problem. Here, I&rsquo;ll start - when I first read the list on Gamasutra, I didn&rsquo;t notice that it included no women until I saw Alice&rsquo;s blog. I&rsquo;m a guy in a male-dominated industry, I hang out with other guys in the industry, and I&rsquo;m influenced (programmed, really), by the media (those in the media, you can&rsquo;t say you&rsquo;re having a cultural impact and then say you&rsquo;re not, when it&rsquo;s convenient). So call me a sexist, I won&rsquo;t deny it. But I recognize the problem. Put the shoe on the other foot. While I may not be alert as I should be to the ill-representation of women, as an Asian-American, it&rsquo;s maddening for me to see TV California towns with just one Asian, or a white-populated San Francisco, or Hawaii shows where the leads are all white, or even a sci-fi series set in a future where everyone speaks Chinese but no one is actually Chinese. This happens not because of a lack of talent or we-don&rsquo;t-have-the-right-role-for-that-type-of-person - it happens because the people in that industry from the top to the bottom will by default select people like themselves, whether it&rsquo;s scriptwriting, casting, or greenlighting.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll close with one more recent example. Last year I watched the Huntington Beach centennial documentary on HBTV, which was a real snoozer until they unexpectedly waded into serious waters and described the <a href="http://www.asianamericanmedia.org/jainternment/">Japanese-American internment</a> of WWII as a &ldquo;difficult question&rdquo; of their loyalties &ldquo;that could not be answered&rdquo; and only described them as &ldquo;Japanese residents&rdquo;, not mentioning that everyone of Japanese descent on the west coast was interned. When I complained to city hall, the response I got was that a &ldquo;diverse&rdquo; panel had approved it, and the CD&rsquo;s had been sent to the local schools! (I can only hope they slept through it). I thought maybe I overreacted, saw it a second time, thought it was even worse than I initially realized, sent another complaint and this time they said they&rsquo;d ask a Japanese-American member of the Orange County Human Relations Commission to look at it. Six or seven months later, they finally stopped showing the piece and distributing the DVD&rsquo;s. I would have preferred that they acknowledged the inadequacy of that segment and just included some additional info with the piece directing viewers to resources such as the <a href="http://www.janm.org/">Japanese American National Museum</a>. But I understand the desire to cover up an embarrassing mistake. Still, I would have appreciated a &ldquo;Our bad, thanks for pointing it out&rdquo;, or even better, taking the issue more seriously the first time and doing a little research and introspection.</p>
