Well, I finally got my T-Mobile Samsung Vibrant completely working after a factory reset and registering it with a gmail account instead of the google account sans gmail that I tried the first time. Without the gmail account, the device set up without complaint and all the Internet services worked except everything Google-based. The device constantly alerted me to Google Talk authentication errors. Adding gmail to my google account didn’t help, and syncing that to the android gmail program also resulted in an authentication error advising me that it might be an issue with my mobile data plan., which I tried avoiding by adding gmail to my google account, which didn’t resolve the problem. Not a useful error message, but still better than the Android Market behavior which allowed me to start downloads and then just stayed in the “Starting download” state.

So I googled (yeah, I know that’s ironic) some similar customer experiences, a few of which were apparently resolved by a factory reset and starting over by supplying a gmail address instead of a non-gmail address to identify a google account. Oddly, these complaints span the last two years but I didn’t see any official google responses confirming that was the issue. So I procrastinated on starting over (I wasn’t looking forward to setting up all my email accounts again - it’s not quite as seamless as the Blackberry), but passed by a T-Mobile store the other day and thought, okay, let’s see if they have an idea. They did - factory reset. It worked, and the T-Mobile rep was similarly surprised (but not really surprised) that starting with a gmail address was a requirement. They really should just say that.
