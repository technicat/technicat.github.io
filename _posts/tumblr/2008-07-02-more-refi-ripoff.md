As the [FBI investigation of Countrywide](http://money.cnn.com/2008/03/08/news/companies/countrywide_FBI/index.htm) proceeds, I get another another sketchy mortgage refi offer in the mail:

It’s urgent! It’s part of a government bill “tailored” just for me! It’s from the official-sounding “Department of NAPF”! And don’t read the fine print!

These guys are easier to find on the web than the last con artists who sent me an offer, the “Negotiation Center” - they actually have a [site](http://www.premierfunding.com/), and several mentions on [Ripoff Report](http://www.ripoffreport.com/) (along with the Negotiation Center)
