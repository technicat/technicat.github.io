[HyperBowl has been on the NOOK Color](http://search.barnesandnoble.com/HyperBowl/Technicat-LLC/e/2940043856555) now for about a week, and so far it’s selling about as well as the iOS version, which means it’s by far my best-selling Android version of [HyperBowl](http://hyperbowl3d.com/).

I was actually a bit tardy in getting on the NOOK bandwagon. I’ve had a NOOK Color for a few months now and registered on the [developer site](http://nookdeveloper.barnesandnoble.com/), but didn’t apply to be a qualified developer until I received an invitation to a developer networking meeting at the Barnes and Noble at [The Grove](http://www.thegrovela.com/) in LA. So I quickly applied, got accepted, and knocked out a version of HyperBowl somewhat tailored for the NOOK Color (adjusted for the screen size, native texture format, etc.) before the meeting. I’d hoped to have it approved by the meeting, but after getting rejected on one technicality it got approved a few days later, and now I just got an update approved, so I’m getting the hang of it.

Overall, I’m pretty impressed with the developer program. I already liked the NOOK Color - it’s a great device and the in-store support at the local B&N’s is reminiscent of the Apple Store, and the developer meeting reminds me of the early days of iOS dev when I attended an Apple tech talk in LA, except this meeting at the B&N involved some pretty good free drinks and food. Which was welcome since I decided to spend a couple of days in the area only to find the local diners in that area (I guess it’s considered West Hollywood?) charge $10 for a burger.

Another thing about the diners - seems like the waiters all look like the next David Boreanaz and despite the heat and humidity, exceptionally good-looking women eschew the air conditioning and sit outside in the patio. My theory is that they’re trying to get “discovered” - this explains all the DVD commentaries where the filmmakers say they just happened to “find” an actress sitting outside of a restaurant.

Anyway back to the dev meeting (and Planet Earth). I only stayed for an hour since I get a little claustrophobic in crowds and I wanted to check out the adjacent [Farmers Market](http://www.farmersmarketla.com/), but I do like to meet other game developers - it’s always helpful and interesting to hear their experiences and see what they’re doing in terms of biz dev and marketing, collaboration, what tools they’re using, and generally they tend to be cool people. Here I met someone I recognized from twitter, Ron Alpert of [Headcase Games](http://headcasegames.com/) and had a pretty good conversation. I downloaded his game 180 on iOS and the NOOK Color - it’s a good-looking game!
