<p>Ironically, now that Apple doesn&rsquo;t allow promo code users to post review on the App Store, I feel freer to dispense codes, particularly on toucharcade where it has seemed to me that posting codes generates some in-forum enthusiasm and a lot of requests for more codes, but not actual sales, and only App Store reviews when someone gets disgruntled (like when I started requiring iOS 3.0 as a minimum).</p>

<p>I still have promo codes to burn (so I sort of wish Apple didn&rsquo;t give out promo codes at all - it really is time-consuming getting rid of these things), so after a long absence I posted some more <a href="http://forums.toucharcade.com/showthread.php?t=95640">HyperBowl  promo codes on toucharcade</a>. The other problem I have every time I do this is that I can&rsquo;t remember the special markup tags, and for some reason they&rsquo;re not easy to find within toucharcade, but once again, google found the <a href="http://forums.toucharcade.com/misc.php?do=bbcode">documentation</a>.</p>

<p>Really, so far I just have two tags that I need to remember so far: [appinfo=all] inserts the App Store description and link, and [youtube] embeds a YouTube video (maybe I&rsquo;ll upgrade to [hdyoutube] or [hqyoutube] next time).</p>
