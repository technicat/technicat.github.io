I finally picked up the Blue-Ray version of Firefly last weekend. Itâ€™s basically the same as the DVD set, but more compact, of course, and includes a fun lunch round-table. It did remind me to update my list of shows that were ended aggravatingly early:

- Firefly
- Deadwood
- Angel
- Dead Like Me
- Wolf Lake
- Now and Again
- Veronica Mars
- Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles
