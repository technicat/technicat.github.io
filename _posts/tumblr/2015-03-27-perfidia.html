My rating: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1219879192">3 of 5 stars</a><br/><br/>
I may have to reread the author&rsquo;s other books, as I recall being totally absorbed them, and Perfidia, being a prequel, features the same characters and jazzy prose. But while I didn&rsquo;t quite have to slog through the chapters, I didn&rsquo;t find the characters that compelling or sympathetic, particularly with the constant racial slurs. That&rsquo;s nothing new in Ellroy novels and can be taken as natural patter in context, even taken ironically, but I can&rsquo;t help feeling the author enjoys writing these words a bit too much, in a Tarantino-esque way. But kudos for placing the Japanese-American internment at the center of the story, even if you don&rsquo;t buy the conspiracy theory.
