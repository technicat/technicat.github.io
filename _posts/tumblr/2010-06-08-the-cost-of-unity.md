I recently ponied up for the Unity 3.0 preorder, which prompted to wonder how much Iâ€™ve invested in Unity overall so far. Checking over my WorldPay emails:

- $249 on October 2006 for Unity Basic 1.5 after seeing a demo at WWDC
- $1289.14 on Auguest 2007 for an upgrade to Unity Pro in a promotion for the Unity 2.0 release
- $399 on October 2008 for Unity iPhone Standard
- $1100 on November 2008 for an upgrade to Unity iPhone Advanced
- $1000 on June 2010 for a preorder upgrade to Unity 3.0
So, about $4000 over for years. Not bad (at least, cheaper than my health insurance!)
