<p>Trying to turn lemons into lemonade, here, with this reply to a Time Warner Business Cable email&hellip;
</p><blockquote>Iâ€™ve given up trying to get Time Warner to stop with the junk email and telemarketing calls, so instead, I would like to return the favor and urge everyone in your company to buy my products. Please visit <a href="http://hyperbowl3d.com/">http://hyperbowl3d.com/</a> and <a href="http://fugugames.com/">http://fugugames.com/</a> to buy and download my mobile games, available on the App Store and Google Play, and check out <a href="http://learnunity4.com/">http://learnunity4.com/</a> for information on my game programming book available at your neighborhood Barnes and Noble and on Amazon and other online bookstores.</blockquote>
