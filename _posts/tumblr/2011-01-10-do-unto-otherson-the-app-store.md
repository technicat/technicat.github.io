I had a long-standing policy of not writing any reviews on the App Store. Actually, it wasn’t so much a policy as I didn’t feel like it. But I figure if I want people to review my apps, I should be principled about it and make an effort to do the same. I’m taking the high road, or the high-rating road, and avoiding writing snarky reviews about free apps, but that’s not entirely due to a sense of honor - it’s just easier to review apps that are good enough to keep on my device and spend time with.

I don’t exactly have a formula, but I reserve one-star for apps that crash immediately or too often, anything that runs reliably gets at least two stars, anything moderately useful or entertaining get three stars, and if it’s something I use regularly, it gets four or five stars. Being a great value (i.e. free or cheap) might add a star. I can’t think of a better way to factor price/value. It’s be nice if there were different rating categories. Also, too bad there’s no web link to a particular user’s reviews (that I know of - to find all mine, I have to find a review I wrote and click on my username). And too bad the the listing of my App Store and Mac App Store reviews are separate (but I guess that goes back to the previous point).

Anyway, not exactly NYT Book Review quality here, but at least now you can see a list of my favorite apps!
