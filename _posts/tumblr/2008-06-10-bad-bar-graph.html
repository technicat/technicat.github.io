<p>Here&rsquo;s a simple but bad graphic representation, courtesy of my mobile phone provider:</p>

<p><a href="http://itshardtofondlepenguins.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/picture-1.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-155" title="picture-1" src="http://itshardtofondlepenguins.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/picture-1.png" alt="" width="256" height="109"/></a></p>

<p>It&rsquo;s just a bar graph that shows my remaining minutes. At first glance, you&rsquo;d think that I was running out of time, but the opposite is true. The bar extends right-to-left, not left-to-right. The red area represents my remaning minutes, so the amount of red actually decreases as I use up my time - when I reach my limit, there will be no red in the graphic - when I&rsquo;ve used no minutes, the graph is completely red.</p>

<p>I suppose this makes sense from their viewpoint - &ldquo;emergency, our customer is under quota!&rdquo;, and later, &ldquo;ah, relax, now he&rsquo;s getting billed for extra minutes&rdquo;. But if you want to make a bar graph that doesn&rsquo;t mislead, examine this one, and do the opposite. Wow, I hope they&rsquo;re not designing, say, mobile phone interfaces.</p>
