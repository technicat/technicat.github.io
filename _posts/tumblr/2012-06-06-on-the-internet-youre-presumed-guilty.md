I feel like I’ve been on defense all week. Yesterday I uploaded a YouTube video of my [Fugu Dance](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.technicat.fugudance) app. Almost immediately, I received this message:[![](http://itshardtofondlepenguins.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Screen-shot-2012-06-06-at-8.00.52-AM.png "Screen shot 2012-06-06 at 8.00.52 AM")](http://itshardtofondlepenguins.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Screen-shot-2012-06-06-at-8.00.52-AM.png)Supposedly, rumblefish has the copyright on the song used in my app, but that song is the “Havana” clip provided with Apple’s iLife Sound Effects. I tried googling for the song I was supposedly infringing and found only one that had a similar name listed in the complaint (“Johnson-Gao, part 1, Love”), but that one sounded completely different. I did find an Apple discussion thread filled with others who ran into the same issue, so I replied to the complaint and cited the thread. A few hours later, I received a message saying rumblefish released their claim. A “sorry for the trouble, thanks for the fractions of a penny we made off your video in the meantime” would have been nice. Now, I wonder if the “original” song cited by rumblefish actually reused the Havana clip via GarageBand just like I did. That would be ironic. And if that is the case, in principle, I should be just as able to cite them for infringing on my property. This procedure at least has some due process and the ability to appeal, and I am somewhat impressed by it’s speediness. It’s an improvement over the takedown of my [Elektra Dance](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/elektra-dance/id298043398) video, where they just sent me a message that someone had complained that it violated YouTube’s policies and thus it’s gone. But you still get the impression that it’s all for the benefit of the big boys. I still have to fill out a DCMA for if I find anything infringing my properties. The other defensive play I had to make this week, I could see potentially could have been for my benefit. Amazon sent me a message saying they found my [Kindle book](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00703SOLC/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=httptechncom-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B00703SOLC) was also on the web:

&nbsp; The web site in question is mine - I wrote a bunch of essays some years ago and recently published them together as a $.99 ebook. So it’s great to know that if someone tries to publish my work on the Kindle, Amazon will catch them. It is a little disconcerting that they didn’t notice this web site advertises my Kindle book and has plenty of copyright notices that match those of my Kindle book and publishing account. And the whole thing comes off as a bit threatening - “respond in five days, or else”.
