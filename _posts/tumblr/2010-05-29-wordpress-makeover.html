<p>If this isn&rsquo;t the first time you&rsquo;ve read this blog, then you&rsquo;re probably noticing the new look. I decided to try out some new Wordpress themes for some reason and eventually settled on one that I already had installed, Barthelme. It has an unusually wide format, with the sidebar on the left, so a lot of the images I was too lazy to shrink now show up uncropped. While I was at it, I customized the widget arrangement in the sidebar, adding the twitter display from Twitter Tools, and added the Add-to-Any plugin for easy tweeting/bookmarking/sharing. (I also tried the AddThis plugin, but Add-to-Any exhibits slightly better behavior on the iPad, although both have trouble getting hidden by the video embed areas).</p>
