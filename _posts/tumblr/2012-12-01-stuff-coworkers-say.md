I was just thinking of something one of my coworkers said on my first day of my first salaried job. Upon hearing that I just got out of MIT, he informed me that “I would have gone to MIT if I’d known about it.” Yup, that’s what the admissions brochure says - “If you heard of us, you’re in.”

The workplace is an environment where you’re stuck listening to comments that you can’t ignore. Much like the Internet. Anyway, here are a few other doozies that I can remember:

“It’s the Traveling Salesman Problem.” Funny when that’s the label applied to every problem that can’t be solve in linear time.

“It’ll be done tomorrow.” Funny when it’s said at every weekly meeting for three months.

“It’s a Sun bug.” Funny when it’s not.

“That’s the only person who had a problem with me.” Funny when it’s not.

“I love Asian women.” OK, that was an interview candidate, but I had to mention that one.

“The product’s released already?” Yup.

“So how much are you getting paid?” There’s no way this question ends well.

“We’ll release the product when it’s ready.” Famous last words.

“Don’t worry, we’ll take care of you.” Management.

“Did you hear Rush Limbaugh this morning? He was great!” Argh.

“America was founded as a Christian nation.” Not so funny considering the guy was trying to make conversation while I was working crunch time with the flu. I could have mentioned that separation-of-church-and-state thing, or that hey, atheist with Muslim ancestors sitting here, or hey, Jewish coworker sitting right there, or hey, you’re Catholic and we could just as easily say this is a Protestant country. Or I could have just coughed on him.

“I have a patent for laser printers.” Liar.

“I was an RAF pilot.” Pants on fire.

“That’s easy. I can get it done in a couple of days.” Lie, but not intentional.
