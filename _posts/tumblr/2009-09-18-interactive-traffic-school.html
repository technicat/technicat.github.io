<p>I&rsquo;m a free man!
</p><blockquote>Dear Philip,

Your traffic school Certificate of Completion has been processed by the court and your case has been dismissed.

Sincerely,

Court Official
West Justice Center
Orange County, California</blockquote>
My &ldquo;case&rdquo; took a while (it was for not stopping at a stop sign - maybe it was a Bostonian rolling stop, but the officer described it as if I&rsquo;d just cruised on through. I&rsquo;d like to see the evidence. When is Google going to have real-time satellite traffic videos?) When I first tried to pay my traffic ticket at the courthouse, they told me &ldquo;you&rsquo;re not in the computer&rdquo;, giving rise to thoughts of a Catch-22 situation where I couldn&rsquo;t pay my ticket but got in trouble for not paying my ticket (anyone see the movie Brazil?) This wasn&rsquo;t helped by the web-site instructions saying I should follow the instructions on the ticket on the &ldquo;courtesy notice&rdquo; which hadn&rsquo;t arrived since I wasn&rsquo;t in the computer, while the ticket itself said I was responsible for following the instructions on the courtesy notice but the courtesy notice was just a courtesy so I might not receive one.

But thankfully(?) I received a letter a month later saying the citing officer mad a &ldquo;mistake&rdquo; and my case was &ldquo;rescheduled&rdquo; and a month after that I received a letter with instructions on selecting a traffic school. In the same envelope was another note instructing me not to select a traffic school for another two weeks because they just changed traffic school systems, and, here&rsquo;s the good part, a modest refund.

I&rsquo;m mildly curious about the in-person schools that employ comedians as instructors - thought that was a made-up idea in King of the Hill - but not that curious. Instead, I decided to make the most of the situation by trying out an online traffic school that featured Flash games, <a href="http://trafficinteractive.com/">Traffic Interactive</a>.

The games are OK, about par for free Flash games. While you might expect a bunch of driving simulations, there&rsquo;s only one driving minigame in the section about choosing the correct lane:

Most of the games have nothing to do with driving, e.g. the one below requires you to harpoon squid - you just score a few points and the game pauses while a popup explains a few driving rules.

I don&rsquo;t even remember what this one is:

Most of the game is filled with non-interactive Flash presentations that border on annoying (actually, they cross the border a few times - I mean, why does that guy keep harping on his grandma&rsquo;s driving? They should show teenagers - they&rsquo;re the worst) And it&rsquo;s still traffic school - games or no games, after a few hours, it feels like it&rsquo;s not going to end. Fortunately, there is a nice map showing your progress in this traffic school wonderland:

And the beauty of an online school is you can log out and log in at anytime. I killed an afternoon completing the bulk of the course but had trouble logging into the final test (which requires additional authentication steps). It took me days before I figured out (there appears to be no functioning help desk) that the pull-down list of courts in the final test login had my court listed twice, once as &ldquo;Online&rdquo; and once as &ldquo;Notary&rdquo;, which &ldquo;Notary&rdquo; listed further down and I had selected that inadvertently. The web design isn&rsquo;t great. On the other hand, the online school cost around $15 and the online authenticated final test (vs. the Notary option which requires you to pay a notary to watch you take it) costs an additional $8. So I finally took the test near midnight duringÂ  a commercial break while watching Conan. You can&rsquo;t beat that for convenience.
