I released [Fugu Bowl 1.5](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/fugubowl/id297032758?mt=8) about a week and a half ago. Basically, it’s just an iPad update, though it seems to me everything does look so much nicer on the big screen! The major changes were really in the previous release, when I threw in the reflective water and skybox from the Unity iPhone Standard Assets, added a real wood texture (from one of the Unity demos) to the rolling plank and an ocean sound.

Alas, the water/sky setup apparently precludes the original lens flare from working, and the ocean sound is drowning out the original pin sounds (which were really more like soft bumping sounds), so I guess there’s more tweaking in store for what was originally a weekend project to get ready for [HyperBowl](http://hyperbowl3d.com/). Still, this is my most-downloaded app and it got a boost with the latest release. Oddly, it’s outpaced [HyperBowl Classic](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/hyperbowl-classic/id322930268?mt=8) even when the latter was free, though HyperBowl easily took a hundred times as much work (and that’s for this port, not counting the work going into the original game). Well, that’s the iPhone app market for you….
