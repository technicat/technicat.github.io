> Portland, Oregon-based painter [Jeff P.](http://www.jeffpdoes.com/) (who goes only by his first name and last initial) remixes traditional scientific illustration techniques to create psychedelic images inspired by nature. Home to Native American peyote ceremonies and multitudinous wildlife species, the southwestern desert has always been a site of escape and self-discovery in the American psyche. Jeff P.â€™s colorful, surreal paintings of snakes call to mind these connotations. While his early work resembled flash tattoo designs, his latest paintings utilize the ornate patterns of various snake species to create colorful, dreamlike designs.
