I decided to spruce up the [HyperBowl](http://hyperbowl3d.com/) site by replacing some links with web badges. But it seems like the meaning of[web badge](//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_badge) has changed - it used to be just a little graphic that links to the advertised site. Now when I search for official web badges on the Facebook or Twitter sites, I get these monstrous Javascript and Flash widgets (I use twitter and Facebook widgets on the [Fugu Games](http://fugugames.com/) site, but they ain’t pretty)

It took me a while, but eventually I figured out the new nomenclature is “press logo” - search for that, and you can find the nice official JPEG and PNG images (and by the way, nice of Internet Explorer to finally support transparent PNG’s!) Ah, much better!
