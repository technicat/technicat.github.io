<p>The last time I watched my favorite television show on movies, <a href="http://www.amctv.com/originals/shootout/">Sunday Shootout</a>, <a href="http://www.sarahjparker.com/">Sarah Jessica Parker</a>, asked about the casting of <a href="http://www.jenniferhudsononline.com/">Jennifer Hudson</a> in the new <a href="http://www.hbo.com/city/">Sex in the City</a> movie, mentioned in her answer that &ldquo;women of color&rdquo; were a loyal part of the television series&rsquo; fan base, and the show had not fulfilled its responsibility to that. If I didn&rsquo;t sound ridiculous saying it, I&rsquo;d say &ldquo;you go, girl!&rdquo;<!--more--></p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a refreshing break from the tired self-justifications (in a segment about the troubles Latino actors have in getting parts, except as terrorists, a casting agent just shrugged and said &ldquo;there just aren&rsquo;t a lot of parts for them&rdquo;) and industry execs&rsquo; proclamations that they&rsquo;re just giving the public what they want.</p>

<p>So maybe I&rsquo;ll go see that Sex in the City movie. Nah.</p>
