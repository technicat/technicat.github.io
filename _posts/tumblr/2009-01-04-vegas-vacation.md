The problem with vacations is I always need a vacation after the vacation. No exception with my recent Vegas trip - I’m still trying to get back into work mode!

I always have mixed feelings about Las Vegas - like, drive there or fly? A drive would take at least five hours, and the last time I drove, I stopped at a hotel on the way back after two hours on the road because I was just too tired. A Jet Blue flight from Long Beach is typically just 45 minutes. But it’s $200 round trip, and my last two flights there had five hour delays. At least the airline gave us some flight credits.

And then there’s Vegas itself. Where the posh meets the crass. For posh, you can’t beat the new [Encore](http://www.encorelasvegas.com/). It opened just before Christmas (with some excellent promotional rates below $200/night), so I probably stayed in a room that had never been used, the 700+ square foot room had a large TV swivelling between the bedroom and living room area, the bathroom had a separate shower and deep tub and small TV, everything from the drapes and lights to the privacy indicator was controlled by a bedside panel, maid service came twice a day, and, a nice little touch, one of the alarm clocks was an iHome that let me recharge my iPod.

The luxurious experience was only tarnished, while I soaked in the tub, by rowdy teenage girls banging on the door to the next room, while some kids in the room yelled at each other “don’t let those little bitches in”. And that was their more polite talk. They only quieted down after their parents returned from their gambling binge at 1am, and then it was all “hi mom, hi dad, goodnight mom, goodnight dad”. I considered blasting the Chinese movie channel at them for the rest of the night but instead got the very helpful and friendly desk people to get me a new room.

I met another vulgar group in the elevator at the nearby Palazzo, also one of the more ritzy hotels. As these guys took turns crudely discussing female anatomy while there were other women in the elevator with us, I flashed to the[Mad Men](http://www.amctv.com/originals/madmen/) episode where Don Draper, in a similar situation, grabbed the hat off one cad and said “take your hat off in front of a lady”. That was pretty cool, I thought, as I exited the elevator without saying anything. I guess I’m no Don Draper. Later, in a Seinfeldian moment, I entered an empty, farty-smelling elevator only to have it stop on another floor where a good-looking woman entered. What was I going to say - it wasn’t me? Jerry Seinfeld would have - to no avail, or course. Oh well, I guess I’m no Jerry Seinfeld, either.
