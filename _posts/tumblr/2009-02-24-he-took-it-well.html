<p>At the end of last week&rsquo;s Lost episode, when the airline captain played by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Fahey">Jeff Fahey</a> realized who was on his plane and calmly stated, &ldquo;We&rsquo;re not going to Guam, are we?&rdquo;, I couldn&rsquo;t help but think, he took that well.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t like to use that phrase, even in my head, ever since I had a boss who liked to take employees into her office, note their personality and performance defects, then remark later &ldquo;he took that well&rdquo;, or &ldquo;she took that well&rdquo;. I guess that&rsquo;s how you characterize suppressed burning resentment. Anyway, I always thought that was an odd thing to say in that context. Do muggers say, after a mugging, &ldquo;he took that well?&rdquo; Or after a mixed martial arts fight, I&rsquo;ve never heard the winner comment in his post-victory interview, &ldquo;he took that beating well&rdquo;, or &ldquo;he took that kick to the head well&rdquo;. I could see one context where it&rsquo;s appropriate - Animal House style fraternity hazing. Thank you, may I have another!</p>
