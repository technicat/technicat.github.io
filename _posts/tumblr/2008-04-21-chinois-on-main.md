This weekend, I returned to Santa Monica for the first time in five years for dinner at Wolfgang Puck’s [Chinois on Main.<!--more-->](http://www.wolfgangpuck.com/restaurants/finedining/chinois/main/)It took me a while to find - although it’s “one of the Country’s premier dining destinations”, according to their surprisingly unpolished web site, no one I asked while I wandered down Main Street from downtown had heard of it. But perhaps I didn’t ask the right people - that area is apparently [Where the Stars Shop](http://www.seeing-stars.com/Shop/MainStreet.shtml). There’s no sign on the restaurant, either, which is surprisingly small, so I dithered around being going in. The food, served family style, didn’t disappoint, included:

- Duck fried rice - how great can that be? But it was pretty darn good.
- Peach vodka martini - nice flavor, but a little heavy, didn’t down it all
- Dim-sum dessert platter - more a dim-sum presentation than food, except for the apple-filled egg rolls. I narrowly missed nailing the diners behind me when I tried to bisect one of the cookies.
- Soft shell crab - lightly fried, soft, chewy, tasty, big enough to remind me of the critters in _Aliens_
The service was prompt (when I knocked my knife off the table, the server behind me immediatly pulled out a fresh one - must happen a lot), but a little snooty, I felt. When we asked for the dessert menu, our server wanted us to clear off more of the main courses, first. The tables are ridiculously small considering some of the huge plates, so perhaps he was just being practical. But after reading the online reviews mentioning sightings of Larry Flynt and David Letterman, I guess I didn’t get the full experience.
