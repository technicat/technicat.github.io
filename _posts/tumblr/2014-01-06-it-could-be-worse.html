<p>The <a href="http://aqicn.org/city/hongkong/">air quality in Hong Kong</a> has been pretty bad, lately:</p>

<p><a href="http://itshardtofondlepenguins.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Screen-Shot-2014-01-05-at-10.09.29-PM.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6448" alt="Screen Shot 2014-01-05 at 10.09.29 PM" src="http://itshardtofondlepenguins.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Screen-Shot-2014-01-05-at-10.09.29-PM.png" width="2202" height="1046"/></a></p>

<p>But it could be worse. Move up to the mainland, and readings move up from &ldquo;unhealthy&rdquo; (red) to &ldquo;very unhealthy&rdquo; (purple), and even a few &ldquo;hazardous&rdquo; (brown) which is the highest level. Burbank smog has nothing on this.</p>
