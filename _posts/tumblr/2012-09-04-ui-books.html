<p>I was talking to someone about user interfaces today and mentioned some of my favorite books on the subject. I might as well share them with everyone:</p>

<p>Apple Human Interface Guidelines (it&rsquo;s actually kind of a mess compared to the original one-volume Mac guidelines, but still…) <a href="http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/AppleHIGuidelines/HIPrinciples/HIPrinciples.html%23//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000353-TP6">http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/AppleHIGuidelines/HIPrinciples/HIPrinciples.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000353-TP6</a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.designinginteractions.com/">http://www.designinginteractions.com/</a> Cool stuff like how the guy who made the Palm walked around with a small slab in his shirt pocket and pretended to use it as PDA as a simulation.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.asktog.com/books/toi_detail.html">http://www.asktog.com/books/toi_detail.html</a> One of the original Mac user interface guys.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/">http://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/</a> Really interesting principles and ways to visualize data - it actually got me interested in data visualization. And looks good on coffee tables.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.jnd.org/books/the-design-of-everyday-things.html">http://www.jnd.org/books/the-design-of-everyday-things.html</a> This really made me think about product design (&ldquo;yeah, the VCR, what&rsquo;s up with that?&rdquo;)</p>
