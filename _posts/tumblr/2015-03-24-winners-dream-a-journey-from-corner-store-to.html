My rating: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1234839347">4 of 5 stars</a><br/><br/>
This is not a particularly insightful business study, and the book drags a bit toward the end where I would expect details of SAP business and recent strategy to be more interesting, but it&rsquo;s hard not to moved by the author&rsquo;s enthusiastic recounting of his youth and how he worked his way up to where he is now. In real life, working with  rah-rah exuberant salespeople can drive me nuts, but this bio gives me a little more understanding of what it takes to survive in that tough business. And hey, the guy is running SAP, now.
