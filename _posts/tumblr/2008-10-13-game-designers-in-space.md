Yesterday, [Richard Garriott](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Garriott), aka Lord British, game designer of the [Ultima](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultima_(video_game_series)) series (including [Ultima Online](http://www.uoherald.com/news/)) and more recently [Tabula Rasa](http://www.rgtr.com/index.html), [rode into space](http://www.richardinspace.com/) aboard a Soyuz launch vehicle. So you aspiring star travellers out there - if NASA rejects your application to join the astronaut corps, you can always fall back to plan B and become a fabulously successful video game designer.
