The last time I watched my favorite television show on movies, [Sunday Shootout](http://www.amctv.com/originals/shootout/), [Sarah Jessica Parker](http://www.sarahjparker.com/), asked about the casting of [Jennifer Hudson](http://www.jenniferhudsononline.com/) in the new [Sex in the City](http://www.hbo.com/city/) movie, mentioned in her answer that “women of color” were a loyal part of the television series’ fan base, and the show had not fulfilled its responsibility to that. If I didn’t sound ridiculous saying it, I’d say “you go, girl!”<!--more-->

It’s a refreshing break from the tired self-justifications (in a segment about the troubles Latino actors have in getting parts, except as terrorists, a casting agent just shrugged and said “there just aren’t a lot of parts for them”) and industry execs’ proclamations that they’re just giving the public what they want.

So maybe I’ll go see that Sex in the City movie. Nah.
