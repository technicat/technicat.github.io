<p><a href="http://www.cbs.com/primetime/ncis/">NCIS</a> has its geek moments, and not just the CSI-like forensics talk or the spy-tech references to encryption methods. In the midst of one of the weekly two, three or four-in-a-row showings on the USA network, I was impressed today by a mention of the open source astronomy viewing program <a href="http://www.shatters.net/celestia/">Celestia</a>. I have no idea how it factored into the plot, but it&rsquo;s a pretty cool program (I mean Celestia, although I must admit <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/17/arts/television/17ncis.html">NCIS is a guilty pleasure</a>)</p>
