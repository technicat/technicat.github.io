<p>At first, I thought I must not have been paying attention since I had never heard of Jeremy Lin until a few days ago. But then I found out I&rsquo;m not alone in that. Now I have to admit I&rsquo;m caught up in Linsanity - I spent much of this weekend watching YouTube videos of his recent Knicks games, his limited Warrior minutes, his D-league games, summer camp games Harvard games, pickup games&hellip;</p>

<p>I admit this is largely due to the Asian-American angle - I liked Yao Ming, too, partly because it was nice to see an Asian guy in the league, and I liked his personality and style of play, but at the time he wasn&rsquo;t an Asian-American and I didn&rsquo;t really feel I had anything common with him. For starters, he&rsquo;s from China and speaks Chinese - I&rsquo;m American-born and I speak English. When Shaq directed some grade-school level pseudo-Chinese babble at Yao, it probably didn&rsquo;t bother him but it bugged the heck out of me. And though Yao was one of the more athletic centers, that&rsquo;s not my least favorite position (I did like Vlade Diva, too, though). Frankly, Tracy McGrady was my favorite Rocket.</p>

<p>Jeremy Lin, though, is a guy like me, insofar he&rsquo;s American-born, speaks English, and has had to put up with racist taunts (even in Ivy League games) and, even though more well-intentioned, silly nicknames like &ldquo;Emperor Lin&rdquo; and whatever Spike Lee was pulling out of cheap martial arts serials. C'mon, the guy is from Palo Alto. African-American NBA players don&rsquo;t have nicknames indicating they&rsquo;re from Africa. Steve Nash is actually from Canada and we don&rsquo;t call him &ldquo;Maple Syrup&rdquo; (that&rsquo;s the only Canadian nickname I can think of).</p>

<p>And speaking of Nash, Lin is a guard in that mold (but bigger and able to dunk), which is another reason I like his play, and considering that he&rsquo;s now on a D'Antoni team with another ex-Sun, Stoudamire, and after watching highlights of the recent games and the post-game interviews with the coach and players, I&rsquo;m afraid I&rsquo;m starting to turn into a Knicks fan, except New Yorkers apparently are insane when it comes to sports (one reason I&rsquo;m warming to D'Antoni is the way he stood up Jeffries in an interview after that guy got booed) I&rsquo;m suprised I haven&rsquo;t heard any cases of any New York Chinese-American basketball fans spontaneously combusting. Oh, wait, I do have an idea for a nickname - &ldquo;The Linternal Combustion Engine&rdquo;. No? OK, I&rsquo;ll stick to watching the videos.</p>
