The one time I attended an MBA party, everyone was talking about the latest episode of Friends. This answered a lot of questions, and perhaps a new one - why Microsoft named their new search engine [Bing](http://www.bing.com/).

It certainly is easy to remember (especially for Friends fans). But take a cue from Google - it doesn’t make for a great active verb. I’m googling. I’m binging? I googled it. I binged it? Perhaps it works better with some extreme sports verve. Bing for it, dude! I binged it, harsh! Hey, I’m trying.
