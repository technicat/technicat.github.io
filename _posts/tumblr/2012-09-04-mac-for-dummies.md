The Apple II was a programmer’s machine. That’s the first thing I did with it when I first saw one in my high school library - sat down, opened the manual, and started learning BASIC. The Mac, for all its wonders, wasn’t. No shell, you had to buy and install Apple’s Pascal-based dev system or something like Think C. Even Windows was more of a programmer’s system, with it’s crappy DOS shell and all. But MacOSX was what I’d been waiting for - basically a NeXt that wasn’t priced $10,000 more than I could afford. A real Unix shell, X Windows…but now in the quest to iOS-ify the Mac, it’s turning into a machine for dummies.

For starters, after upgrading from Snow Leopard to Mountain Lion, I couldn’t find my Library directory (excuse me, folder) anymore. It’s hidden for my protection, I guess. I had to google to find out I have to hold down the option key with the Go menu down to see it. I had to mess around with the Finder preferences to get the main hard drive (and thus all the directories not inside my user directory) to show up. “Save As” is gone from the Preview application (or do I have to call it an app now?) Was it considered too confusing? Now it’s split into Duplicate and Rename, which had the unfortunate result that I went straight to Rename and thus clobbered the original version of my image. Save As was actually safer. And I haven’t figured out what’s the point of the Launcher. I mean, now we have a Dock and a Launcher and I’m still going to the Applications directory. And what’s going on with the scrollbars? Now you see them, now you don’t, and when I see them they’re getting in the way of something I’m trying to click on. And Apple has had a twenty-year allergy to a second (not to mention third) mouse button but we’re supposed to scroll with the mouse now?

OK, now I’m ranting. That’s what happens when you mess with a perfectly good programmer’s m achine.
