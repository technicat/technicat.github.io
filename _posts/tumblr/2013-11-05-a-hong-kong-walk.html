<p>This is one of my more surprising discoveries in Hong Kong - a really nice walk/jog/bike path extending from the TKO MTR station to the Lohas Park MTR station, just about a mile in length and covering two thirds of my walk to work (unfortunately that last third goes by an actively-used landfill) It&rsquo;s a bit warm in the day but it&rsquo;s nice to see fishermen, cyclists, joggers, and tai-chi practitioners. I prefer the evening with the night skyline and cooler weather, although disconcertingly there are occasional packs of stray dogs. Sort of like a scene from Wolfen but they wag their tails and run up to you. They are dogs, after all.</p>
