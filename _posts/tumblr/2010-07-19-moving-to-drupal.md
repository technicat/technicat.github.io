For a while, I stopped updating the [technicat](http://technicat.com/) web site because, well, because I couldn’t. After updating my Mac to Snow Leopard (forced to, because the latest XCode required it), I couldn’t run [Apache Forrest](http://forrest.apache.org/) anymore because that doesn’t run on Java 6. I was leaning toward [Drupal](http://drupal.org/) and finally committed to it this weekend. It involved some contortions - ultimately, I have [http://technicat.com/](http://technicat.com/) redirecting to [http://drupal.technicat.com/](http://drupal.technicat.com/) (and the old site is at [http://forrest.technicat.com/](http://forrest.technicat.com/) )

It’s more of a Drupal-for-Dummies setup, so I can’t add plugins or themes, and I suspect there’s something wrong with the installation or me, since I don’t see some things that I think I should be seeing (like a Contact form and image upload options), but basically, it works, and I found a theme that doesn’t look terrible. Now, I have to start updating the content…
