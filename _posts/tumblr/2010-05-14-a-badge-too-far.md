The ABC Player on my iPad is by far the leading consumer of my iPad hours - I’ve been catching up on episodes of Lost, Flash Forward, V, Modern Family…But do they have to have that ABC badge constantly on-screen? Admittedly it’s smaller than most of the logos on television, but on a bright background it’s still very noticeable. And it’s the ABC Player - it only features ABC shows. By the time I select a show and hit Play, I’ve got the message.
