Travelling down memory lane, I found I’m able to play some old interactive fiction titles, a la [Infocom](http://www.infocom-if.org/), like this [Scott Adams](http://www.brasslantern.org/community/history/adams.html) adventure (check out his [lecture](http://jerz.setonhill.edu/if/adams/scottspeaks.html)), by installing [Zoom](http://www.logicalshift.co.uk/unix/zoom/) and downloading [ZCode](http://www.wurb.com/if/platform/1) games from the [Interactive Fiction Archive](http://www.ifarchive.org/). I’m no better at text adventures than 3D games, but at least the resulting death is less gory.

One of these days, I might try out [Inform](http://www.inform-fiction.org), a natural language based system for designing interactive fiction. It looks pretty slick.
