_Originally written on Epinions in July 2003:_

Here’s a shocker. Southerners aren’t always warm and friendly. I know this sounds naive, but I’m genuinely surprised - I’ve worked in Dallas and visited New Orleans, and I’ve always found southerners less cold than my Californian brethren and less grouchy than folks in New England.

But after taking a red-eye flight from Long Beach to Atlanta and then driving a rental car two hours up to Chattanooga, I was treated to my first dose of southern inhospitality at the Read House.

After reading several lines of instructions posted in the driving entrance on how to pull up to the line and turn off the ignition for the parking valet (self-parking is not an option), I couldn’t see the aforementioned but nearly worn-out line and pulled up too far. The missing valet suddenly appeared and instructed me to pull back to the “stop” sign, which I guessed was where I started, then he instructed me to pull forward again, and then (once more with feeling) after I turned off the ignition he told me to get back in and pull to the side to allow other traffic by.

After checking in with a slightly less surly desk attendant, I found my suite to be spacious, but in need of renovation and a good scrubbing. A cursory examination revealed slightly stained and curling wallpaper, a discolored bathtub (prompting me to skip my usual travel soaks), a not-quite-empty wine bottle under the minibar (no fridge) sink, a cigarette burn hole in the sheets on the queen bed, and stains on the ironing board in the closet, which motivated me to try ironing my shirts on the non-stained portions of the sofa.

On the plus side, the air conditioning worked well, which is critical in a Tennessee summer, and the downtown location is convenient - the aquarium, restaurants, and shopping outlets are within half a mile and easily walkable or accessible via the free downtown shuttle, which runs every five minutes. The hotel has no facilities (gift shop, gym, pool) aside from a restaurant called The Tavern, which is open for breakfast, lunch, and sometimes dinner.

During my stay, I did warm up to the place. I initially chose the Read House for its price, location and historic ambience (the building dates back to the Civil War) - all reasons which were validated during my stay - and the service seemed improved (I didn’t see the first parking valet again, depriving me the satisfaction of stiffing him on the tip).

To be fair, from my four days there, it seems that testiness characterizes the Chattanoogan service industry in general. Maybe it’s the humidity. But if I ever have occasion to visit Chattanooga again, I’ll try another hotel - for rudeness, I’ll go to Boston, where they do it right.
