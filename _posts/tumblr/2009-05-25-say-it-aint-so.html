<p>I learned from <a href="http://danweinreb.org/blog/why-did-mit-switch-from-scheme-to-python">Daniel Weinreb&rsquo;s blog</a> that <a href="http://ocw.mit.edu/OcwWeb/Electrical-Engineering-and-Computer-Science/6-001Spring-2005/CourseHome/">6.001 Structures and Interpretations of Computer Programming</a> is retired from the MIT computer science curriculum. There are many MIT courses that I didn&rsquo;t understand (and barely passed) and realized later were really useful. This is a course that I didn&rsquo;t understand but learned to appreciate after the fact. Of course I didn&rsquo;t have much cause to use Scheme in my career (although a surprising amount of Lisp), but as software professionals try to treat their practice more and more as manufacturing (which strikes me as squeezing a cube into a circular receptacle), 6.001 and it&rsquo;s accompanying <a href="http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/book/book.html">text</a> was one of the few works that pushes for intellectual and esthetic appreciation of programming and was still cool to cite among bloggers (a few mentions by <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/">Joel On Software</a>). Oh well, back to design patterns and agile development.</p>
