My favorite term that I learned in high school math (or perhaps college math?) was “monotonically increasing,” for some reason. Now, it describes my health insurance premiums:

As you can see, my premiums have almost doubled in less than half a year, raised at first because my insurer said Obamacare was going to pose additional costs, and then again because they noticed my zip code had changed from Southern California to Northern California (I’m still trying to figure out how the Bay Area is more hazardous to my health than Orange County). Call me cynical, but given that my premiums regularly go up for unspecified increases in the general cost of health care, and just for getting a year older (“Hey you’re still alive! Let’s raise your premium!”), I’m just a little bit skeptical. Which reminds me, I just had my birthday, so another increase is probably on the way…
