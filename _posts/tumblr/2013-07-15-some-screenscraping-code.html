This is a first - I actually removed an app from sale last week, WordsEye Feature, because the WordsEye site is undergoing some remodeling (the $100k in seed funding they won in an entrepreneurship contest probably has something to do with it). This demonstrates the problem with depending on someone else&rsquo;s site for your app content and also the problem with screenscraping the content, which is pretty much the least robust approach to accessing web data. I could have tried updating my code, but I&rsquo;d rather wait for a WordsEye API. In the meantime, here&rsquo;s what some Unity screenscraping code looks like - it&rsquo;s not that complicated, the tricky part is getting the regular expressions right. And screenscrape responsibly! (I made this app with permission).

<pre>
function Refresh() {	 
     // Start a download of the given URL
    var www : WWW = new WWW (url);
    // Wait for download to complete
    yield www;
    
    if (<a href="http://www.error">www.error</a> != null) {
    	SetTitleText(<a href="http://www.error">www.error</a>);
    } else {
    	var match = regexp.Match(<a href="http://www.text">www.text</a>);
     	var text = match.Groups[4].Value;
        SetScrollText(text);
        var title = match.Groups[1].Value;
     	var author = match.Groups[2].Value;
     	SetTitleText("Loading...");
        var imageurl = match.Groups[3].Value;
    	var imagewww : WWW = new WWW ("http://wordseye.com"+imageurl);
  // Wait for download to complete
    yield imagewww;
      if (imagewww.error != null) {
    	SetTitleText("Error loading "+title+"n"+imagewww.error);
    } else {
    	 SetTitleText(title+"n"+author);
	imagewww.LoadImageIntoTexture(render.guiTexture.texture); 	
    }
    }
       lastdisplay = Time.time;
       <a href="http://www.Dispose">www.Dispose</a>();
       if (imagewww != null) {
      	 imagewww.Dispose();
       }
}

</pre>
