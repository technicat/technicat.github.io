<p>Since I got <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/fugu-maze/id426993175?mt=12">Fugu Maze</a> on the Mac App Store, I&rsquo;m wondering what to do about my <a href="http://fugugames.com/">Fugu Games</a> widgets that I listed on the Apple download site. On the one hand they&rsquo;re old, not actively maintained and don&rsquo;t generate any revenue. On the other hand, I still had five thousand downloads of them this month (How to turn those into paying customers? Problem to be solved later). In any case, looks like the <a href="http://www.apple.com/downloads/">Apple download site</a> is disappearing - the page now mainly describes the Mac App Store. It does still point to the <a href="http://www.apple.com/downloads/dashboard/just_added/">widget listing</a>. but recent additions are sparse - either developers are losing interest or Apple has stopped accepting them (or both).</p>
