<p>The <a href="http://www.fugugames.com/">Fugu Games</a> site showcases <a href="http://www.fugugames.com/mobilegames.html">J2ME cell phone games</a> developed by Digimana. They&rsquo;re playable from the web page via Java Web Start and an emulator called <a href="http://www.mpowerplayer.com/">MPowerPlayer</a>. The emulation isn&rsquo;t quite perfect - some of the game screen sizes don&rsquo;t match, for best results you should quit the emulator before starting a new game, and for a brief period recently it seemed the emulator wasn&rsquo;t working at all, but when it works, it&rsquo;s pretty cool.</p>

<p>For example, Cunning Rabbit looks pretty good.</p>

<p>Mahjong also fills the screen quite nicely.</p>

<p>And there is a variation called Shanghai Mahjong.</p>

<p>Babysplat seems to be the most popular, according to the site web log and my friends. There&rsquo;s also a similar game called BugSlayer.</p>

<p>And Poker, with a diabolical-looking dealer. (Blackjack is similar)</p>
