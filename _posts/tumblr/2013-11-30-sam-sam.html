<p>While I&rsquo;m in Hong Kong, I figured I should learn Cantonese by watching TV. I don&rsquo;t know why I thought that would work - twelve years in California and I haven&rsquo;t learned a word of Spanish from watching Telemundo. But actually I found that I could pick up some phrases by watching children shows dubbed in Cantonese. In other words, talk to me slowly and with simple words like I&rsquo;m a two-year old, and I might get it. I gotta tell you, I&rsquo;m getting pretty sick of Thomas and Friends. Maybe it&rsquo;s just the Cantonese, but for a tank engine, he sure sounds like a whiner. This show Sam Sam is pretty cool, though. And I think it&rsquo;s working - I understand the Cantonese dubbing better than the original French.</p>
