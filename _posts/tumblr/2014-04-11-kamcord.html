<p>I&rsquo;m looking forward to the eventual Unity integration of in-game video capture (&ldquo;social gaming&rdquo; for the buzzword-aware), but in the meantime, I tried out the plugin from <a href="http://kamcord.com/">Kamcord</a> a while ago on my <a href="http://learnunity4.com/">Learn Unity</a> book companion app, and it works great. Besides the video capture, it has a nice built-in GUI for video sharing, including YouTube, of course.</p>
