<p>I used to be one of those programmers who complained about receiving terribly vague bug reports that resemble my nephew&rsquo;s account of how he got a coin stuck up his nose ( &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t do anything&hellip;&rdquo;). Now I&rsquo;m on the other side - recently I submitted a report in which I described step-by-step how to reproduce the bug from a newly-created project, and I got a reflexive &ldquo;can you attach a project&rdquo; response for my trouble.</p>

<p>I fear now that we&rsquo;re in the texting and YouTube era, bug reports will require video. I&rsquo;ve even seen one game QA group attach or link movies to their bug reports on their own initiative (I think it was Darkwatch, but I&rsquo;m not sure). I found one <a href="http://hyperbowl3d.com/">HyperBowl</a> bug demonstrated on YouTube, which was good motivation for getting it fixed&hellip;(I can prioritize bugs based on the number of YouTube views)</p>
