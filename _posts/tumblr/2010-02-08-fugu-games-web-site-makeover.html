<p>I took a break from <a href="http://hyperbowl3d.com/">HyperBowl</a> this weekend to give the long-neglected <a href="http://fugugames.com/">Fugu Games</a> web site a makeover. It has long suffered as the repository for throwing in anything I thought looked cool. That&rsquo;s sort of its mission statement, but as with household cleaning, sometimes stuff has to go.</p>

<p>So I finally retired my early attempts at Java web games (just a couple of board games attempting to demonstrate a fairly complicated framework that could alternately target Swing and J2ME), a little Flash 3D (Papervision3d) demo, etc. The remainder now fits on one page, which allows me to use the same CSS trick I used on the HyperBowl site to present a more compact view on the iPhone web browser.</p>

<p>Finally, I went back to starting off the page with a Unity web player that acts as a menu for loading the other web players via the <a href="http://WWW.LoadUnityWeb">WWW.LoadUnityWeb</a> function. I had a simple one with GUITextures back when I started using Unity and then abandoned it when LoadUnityWeb broke in Unity 2.0. I swore off using it, even though reportedly it&rsquo;d been fixed, but sometimes there&rsquo;s just one right function for the job, so I put together a new one (having lost the old one). This one is a bit more fun - the &ldquo;menu&rdquo; items are little 3D fugu balls that look at the mouse cursor as you move it around and swell up a bit as their mouseover behavior. I&rsquo;d also like to add a mouseover sound like &ldquo;click me!&rdquo;, and it could use a load progress indicator (I think I&rsquo;ll have the selected fugu ball swell up to fill the screen - stay tuned). Oh yeah, and I&rsquo;ll have to fix all the web players that get loaded - it&rsquo;s amazing (not in a good way) how software just stops working after a while.</p>
