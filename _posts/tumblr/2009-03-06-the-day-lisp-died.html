<p>Ok, that title is overlay dramatic. I hope. But I read the 1996 <a href="http://java.sun.com/docs/white/langenv/">Java white paper</a> recently and noticed the conspicuous absence of Lisp in its comparison with other languages.</p>

<p>Of course, not every language can be included. No Ada, for example. And it makes sense to just list languages in common use. But Smalltalk? Maybe Smalltalk is chosen to represent the closest thing to a design goal for Java, but Lisp would match up just as well in the table (except maybe for security), and I&rsquo;m under the impression that Java team came largely from a Lisp Â background (Jim &ldquo;Emacs&rdquo; Gosling, Frank &ldquo;Lucid&rdquo; Yellin&hellip;), and I highly doubt they said, &ldquo;forget Lisp, what we really want is something like Smalltalk&rdquo;. I can only surmise that Lisp was too tainted by the AI crash to even mention. It&rsquo;s sad - as if by omission they declared Lisp irrelevant.</p>
