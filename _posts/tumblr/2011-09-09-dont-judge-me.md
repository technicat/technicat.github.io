So the other day I was staying in a Holiday Inn Express in Dana Point and decided to try out the BBQ place next door. I regretted it immediately, as it turned into a sequence of my least favorite scenarios. There was one guy at the bar who looked like he’d been occupying that seat for a long time, who proceeded to quote scripture to me (“Judge not lest ye be judged”), then interrogated me about my “nationality” (“Japanese? Filipino?”), then wanted me to help him with his Android phone.

Once we got his phone working, though, he made me google his name and it turns out he’s a local skateboarding legend, Stitch Hitchcock.

I later read about him in an article on the [Salt Creek Beach Crew](http://www.ocweekly.com/2009-01-15/news/skitch-hitchcock-salt-creek-beach-crew-skateboarding/), which really just depressed me more to see that he’s drinking again (if not, I can’t account for why he sang me a farewell, “I’m turning Chinese, I’m turning Chinese…”) So I took my BBQ back to my room, which amazingly for a budget hotel had a jacuzzi tub and flat-screen TV in the bathroom, and watched HBO while munching on BBQ and sitting in the tub. Don’t judge me.
