[Portal](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portal_(video_game)) was one of the more recently hyped games this year among game developer circles, partly because it’s a great motivational [story](http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/3839/thinking_with_portals_creating_.php) of game developers right of school ([DigiPen](http://digipen.edu/)) getting discovered by a high-profile outfit ([Valve](http://valvesoftware.com/)), and getting their game concept developed and bundled in [The Orange Box](http://orange.half-life2.com/).

I have to agree it’s the most innovative one I’ve played this year - check out this video:

and there is a an interesting-looking fan-created [Flash homage](http://armorgames.com/play/107/portal-the-flash-version)
