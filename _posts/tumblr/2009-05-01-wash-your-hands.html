<p>With the swine flu, I&rsquo;m no so much worried about the border or airplanes (well, I&rsquo;m always worried about airplanes). I&rsquo;m worried about the admonition for everyone to wash their hands. Have you seen a public bathroom? I&rsquo;ve seen a Starbucks bathroom with no hand soap. I&rsquo;ve been in a Borders bathroom where I guy walked out of a stall, picked up the smoothie he left on the sink, and walked out without washing his hands. Now, that&rsquo;s gross.</p>

<p>Maybe more people would wash their hands if hand-drying was fun. At the Long Beach Airport, I saw the <a href="http://www.dysonairblade.com/homepage.asp">Dyson Hand Dryer</a>. That thing was cool.</p>
