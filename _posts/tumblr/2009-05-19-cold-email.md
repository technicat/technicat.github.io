Aaron Mark’s [The Complete Guide to Game Audio](http://filmsound.org/game-audio/gameaudiobook.htm)is one of my favorite game industry books, even though I know squat about audio (well, maybe that’s one reason I like it). Much of the career advice is generally useful to game industry freelancers, including tips on marketing yourself. I’ve noticed one common-sense tip on direct email marketing usually goes unheeded - do some research, find the name of the contact, and personalize the message as much as possible. I get a lot of game audio solicitations (it’s a tough business - I’ve only been one one game project that has used more than one audio person), and nearly all look like form letters without even addressing the name of my company.

So I nearly fell off my chair when I received an email that started with my name and included the name of my company. Just from that, I wanted to give the sender, [Adgio Hutchings](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1804098/), a contract (never mind that I’m a one-person company making tiny games). And bonus, the attached PDF portfolio mentioned work that I’d seen in [On The Lot](http://www.thelot.com/):

I wish more solicitations were like this, but I don’t really hold it against game audio professionals - I receive worse from product marketing managers who should know better. One middleware company launching a new product sent me a form email asking for meeting at GDC, and then a week later the same email, but addressed to a contact at another company and BCC’d to me. Isn’t a facility with email programs a minimal requirement for marketing positions? Another product manager from a telcom inquired about deploying one of my cell phone games. I asked which one? He gave a general description. But which one in particular? You can just try them all on my web site within a web browser. He repeated the same vague requirements. It was like a Turing Test in which the human failed.
