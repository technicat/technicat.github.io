<p>While I decided to dispense with Google Ads for now, I&rsquo;m still leaving an ad-space-for-rent on my <a href="http://technicat.com/">Technicat</a> site. I&rsquo;m not terribly interested in advertising as a business model, but I receive inquiries from ad brokers (or adbots - they tend to have odd names and never have the courtesy to reply when I politely decline), so just so I don&rsquo;t have to tell them I don&rsquo;t have any advertising spots available, I&rsquo;ll now direct them to the space on the left:</p>

<p><a href="http://itshardtofondlepenguins.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/Screen-shot-2010-10-06-at-9.33.24-AM.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3890" title="Screen shot 2010-10-06 at 9.33.24 AM" src="http://itshardtofondlepenguins.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/Screen-shot-2010-10-06-at-9.33.24-AM.png" alt="" width="629" height="496"/></a></p>

<p>I went with AdvertiseSpace out of convenience, since I just bought a bunch of ads through them for <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/hyperbowl/id344209253?mt=8">HyperBowl</a>. They don&rsquo;t have the performance tracking features of BuySellAds, but the latter has a long list of &ldquo;criteria/suggestions&rdquo; for site approval, including 100,000+ impressions per month. Based on my Google Ad experiment, I&rsquo;m just getting 3,000 (nothwithstanding the once-every-three-year flurry I get from digg or reddit). But then again, based on the Google results I should charge $3/month. I&rsquo;m charging a lot more, so I don&rsquo;t expect to sell the spot, but hey, all it takes is one.</p>
