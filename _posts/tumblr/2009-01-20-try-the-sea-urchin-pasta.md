I recently returned from my fourth trip to Waikiki. Some like the sun and surf - me, I like the food. I’ve got a few favorite eateries in the area by now, such as [Ono Cheesesteak](http://www.onocheesesteak.com/) (breakfast sandwich with a cup of Kona coffee for $2.95), [Jimbo's&nbsp;](http://onokinegrindz.typepad.com/ono_kine_grindz/2005/04/jimbos.html)&nbsp;for Japanese noodles, and&nbsp;[Fatty’s Chinese Fast Food](http://www.yelp.com/biz/fattys-chinese-fast-food-honolulu) (where you sit on a stool around an old-fashioned wok kitchen) in the [International Marketplace.](http://www.internationalmarketplacewaikiki.com/)

Among new places, I tried a [Puka Dog](http://www.pukadog.com/), also in the marketplace, with garlic mustard and pineapple relish.

And on the higher end of the scale, uni “sea urchin” pasta at [Taormina](http://taorminarestaurant.com/).
