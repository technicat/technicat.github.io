At work, I received several recommendations for the club sandwich served in the company cafeteria (the Chinese name for it actually is more like “company” sandwich). It’s just like an American club sandwich, but instead of bacon and turkey, there’s ham and tuna and scrambled egg. In other words, it’s totally different. But it’s good. Seriously, when I get back to the states, I might open up a franchise.
