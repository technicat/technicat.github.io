<p>Yesterday morning, I got a rather snippy response from a software support forum. That, plus what passes for unusually dreary weather here in Huntington Beach, reminded me of a practice I used to keep - don&rsquo;t bug people about anything on Mondays, or before lunch. Especially Monday before lunch. If anyone&rsquo;s going to be out of sorts, it&rsquo;ll be then. (these days, it&rsquo;s difficult to apply that rule since I deal with clients and vendors in different time zones - I suppose that&rsquo;s increasingly true for everyone)</p>

<p>You can apply the rule if you&rsquo;re on the receiving end, too. Before emailing or posting that long diatribe of a response, go to lunch. Besides feeling in better spirits and sleepy (if you&rsquo;ve bellied up to the trough at an Indian buffet), you might realize that the question you got was totally different than what you&rsquo;ve thought. Just letting a message sit for a while has saved me some long-winded replies.</p>

<p>And read what you write. If I can&rsquo;t seem to expand on a point without it getting tedious or taking on a negative tone, I&rsquo;ll just throw out everything but the high points, or sometimes just give up on the message. It seems like an obvious point, but clearly there are those who could benefit from a &ldquo;Do you really want to send that?&rdquo; popup box. A micromanaging employer who was forwarded my request for a box of kleenex from the secretary emailed me saying I wasn&rsquo;t polite enough, and then proceeded to say that was typical of insensitive programmers. When I didn&rsquo;t reply, she kept sending longer and more annoying emails. It was like having an insult comic as your boss.</p>

<p>In a more succinct display of irony, another boss of mine emailed me on a company list chastising me for publicly chastising another employee. A fun part of that episode - another manager thought I was criticizing her (since I didn&rsquo;t name my target) and broadcast an angry retort but then panicked and tried to cancel the email. So when she apologized to me about her message, it turned out I was the only one who hadn&rsquo;t seen it and I had no idea what she was talkingÂ  about. Ah, the corporate life&hellip;</p>
