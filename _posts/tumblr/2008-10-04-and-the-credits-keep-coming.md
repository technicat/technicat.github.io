The controversy over game crediting standards continues, but if the [recent gamasutra feature](http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/3808/giving_credit_where_credit_is_due.php) is any indication, the level of discussion is fairly shallow. For example, Mark Jacobs defending the [EA Mythic crediting decisions](http://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=19931) that sparked much of the current discussion:

> “So we’ve always had a standard policy – we credit the people who are here at the game’s launch. That’s it. We make no other distinction. It doesn’t matter if you’ve been here for a day, a week, or all four years. If you’re not here at launch, you don’t get credit.”

That policy has the merit of being of consistent. But in discussing plans to deploy an online database with complete credits, which will be interesting to see if it really does happen (why not work something out with [MobyGames](http://www.mobygames.com/)?), he expresses his real feelings:

> “The more glorious credits go to those who were here at launch because they saw the product through to the end, and the online credits are for everybody.”

I’d like to be that guy who was there “for a day” and got the “glorious” credit for seeing it “through to the end”. Here’s Doug Lombardi of [Valve](http://www.valvesoftware.com/), which has a fairer practice of listing everyone in their credits, but without titles.

> “You know, in the movie industry, some people put credits at the beginning of their films, some at the end, it’s a creative call. I don’t understand why it needs to be standardized.”

There is a lot of creativity in displaying film credits, because the credits themselves are required by the unions, e.g. the [WGA](http://www.wga.org/). I’m reading a pretty interesting book called [What Happens Next](http://www.salon.com/books/review/2007/10/25/norman/) that describes how screenwriters unionized largely out of unfair crediting practices (producers would just credit whomever they favored - sound familiar?) And referring to the[IGDA Game Credit Guide](http://www.igda.org/wiki/IGDA_Credits_and_Awards_Committee):

> “I would need to understand why I’d need to spend the time to read such a thing.”

He’s a VP of Marketing, so normally I’d agree, (and if you’re in marketing, a game credit is more of a bonus than a professional sustenance issue), but if you’re granting an interview to Gamasutra discussing this matter, that’s one reason to do a little research.
