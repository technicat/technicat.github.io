One of my game design rules is to make the most of my middleware, or, to put it more crassly, get my money’s worth (this is why I’ll never write a game design book). So after I purchased [GUIKit001](http://gameassets.net/) for the [HyperBowl](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/hyperbowl/id344209253?mt=8) pause menu, I started adding it to all my other apps, even the ones I’d said didn’t need one. Case in point, the latest update of [Fugu Maze](http://itunes.apple.com/app/fugu-maze/id295808255?mt=8) (which also now features two of the three [Prime31](http://prime31.com/) plugins I’ve purchased):
