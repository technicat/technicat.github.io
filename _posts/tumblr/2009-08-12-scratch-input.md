At [Siggraph](http://siggraph.org/) last week, I cheaped out and just got the basic pass which let me in the exhibits and some extras. [Jason Della Rocca](http://realitypanic.com/) encouraged me to check out the Emerging Tech demos presented by various research groups, and Iâ€™d have to say that was good advice - that was my favorite part of the show. There was some wild and wacky stuff, like the breath odor input device, but it was the Scratch Input demo that most intrigued me. With various scratching movements on a tabletop, I could activate and control voice mail and a music player running on laptops.
