<p>Now that Jet Blue has direct flights from Long Beach to San Francisco International (SFO), I&rsquo;ve been going up there a little more often and have worked out a routine. Jet Blue is in the International terminal, which has a BART station (light rail to downtown San Francisco and beyond) flight museum, cool art displays, a bookstore with a fine selection (last week I picked up Walking Dead #3, The Billion Dollar Brain, Game of Thrones and I Am Legend), and excellent food courts (note there are two - I made the mistake of frequenting just one for a while and not realizing the other had a larger dim sum selection). It&rsquo;s still overpriced airport food, of course, but if you&rsquo;re on a budget you can get a decent-sized bowl of jook for $3.50.</p>

<p>For last week&rsquo;s Game Developer Conference I was tempted to plunk down $300 for a night a the Parc 55 in San Francisco, but sanity prevailed and I went with my usual - $80 for a &ldquo;junior king&rdquo; room at the Red Roof Inn in Burlingame ($70 for a regular room, but I like the big L-shaped work desk in deluxe room). It has the convenience of same-day cancellation ( you can cancel up to 6pm of the arrival day), a 24-hour restaurant (I routinely get a slice of cheesecake and coke late at night) and you can take the frequent shuttle bus to the airport and catch the BART into San Francisco. One trick, all the hotels clustered in that area near the airport have regular shuttle buses, so if you remember which ones are near each other, you can grab the first close bus that comes by, e.g. when I arrived instead of waiting for the Red Roof shuttle, I saw the Embassy Suites bus arrive first so I grabbed that one and just walked across the street to my hotel.</p>

<p>If I want to rent a car for a day, I take the shuttle into the airport and take the Airtrain there to the car rental center. So far I&rsquo;m happy with Alamo - they rented me bright green Mazda 2 for $30 a day last time, while Dollar tried to sell me on a Corvette for $120/day (when I asked for something cheaper they suggested a BMW for $100/day). Keep in mind there&rsquo;s a $20 &ldquo;airport access free&rdquo; tacked onto the bill.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re driving around, check out Coyote Point, a beach/marina right next to that hotel area.</p>
