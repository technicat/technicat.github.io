Following on the rousing success of [my first ebook published for the Nook](http://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/technicat-on-software-phil-chu/1108218697) (three sales) via Barnes and Noble’s PubIt! program, I uploaded the same epub file (with a slight style tweak for the book title to get it to show up on a separate page) to the Kindle Direct Publishing program, so now it’s [available on Kindle devices and apps](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00703SOLC/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=httptechncom-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B00703SOLC) ![](http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=httptechncom-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B00703SOLC)

Overall, it came out slightly better. For example, the cover fills the screen, unlike on my Nook Color (I used the Nook Color screen size, 1024x600, as my cover size, but I think something like 500x800 would have been better) As with icons for apps, the book cover is one of those annoying last minute details. I like the way this one came out, reusing the image I created using [WordsEye](http://wordseye.com/).
