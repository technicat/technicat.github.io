The [Fugu Games](http://www.fugugames.com/) site showcases [J2ME cell phone games](http://www.fugugames.com/mobilegames.html) developed by Digimana. They’re playable from the web page via Java Web Start and an emulator called [MPowerPlayer](http://www.mpowerplayer.com/). The emulation isn’t quite perfect - some of the game screen sizes don’t match, for best results you should quit the emulator before starting a new game, and for a brief period recently it seemed the emulator wasn’t working at all, but when it works, it’s pretty cool.

For example, Cunning Rabbit looks pretty good.

Mahjong also fills the screen quite nicely.

And there is a variation called Shanghai Mahjong.

Babysplat seems to be the most popular, according to the site web log and my friends. There’s also a similar game called BugSlayer.

And Poker, with a diabolical-looking dealer. (Blackjack is similar)
