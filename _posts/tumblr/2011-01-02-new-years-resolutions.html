<p>I accomplished the first of my New Year&rsquo;s resolutions (or if Microsoft-branded, Resolutions 2011), this morning, calling ehealthinsurance to cancel my Anthem Blue Cross coverage (mainly because they kept raising my premium, but I think it was their use of the now-cliched &ldquo;we&rsquo;re all in this together&rdquo; that put me over the edge). Technically, I did all the real work a few weeks ago in applying for a replacement policy, but I&rsquo;ll score this in the win column for the new year. I have to say, I was impressed that ehealthinsurance was manning the phone lines today - contrast that to one of my phone calls to HealthNet, which terminated when they transferred me to a department that had gone home for the day.</p>

<p>Now, time to get started on my other resolutions. Lose ten pounds (to mollify Wii Fit, which is actually telling me to lose twenty to achieve my ideal weight, but get real). Finish reading my partially-read books (I stopped marking them as &ldquo;currently-reading&rdquo; on goodreads - it was getting embarrassing). Fix my bathroom. Fix my kitchen. Fix my laundry room. Or maybe just move. Learn Japanese. Learn Spanish. Learn Objective-C. Start Android development. Put HyperBowl on the Mac App store. Put something on the Unity Asset Store. Recoup my Unity 3 investment before Unity 4 comes out. Finish that screenplay. Or the other one. Or the novel. And write in complete sentences.</p>
