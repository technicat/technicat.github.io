<p>After filling up my iPad with free apps, I finally loosened the purse strings a bit and bought Tune Runner HD. I already knew it&rsquo;s a pretty cool game since I have the free iPhone version, and besides, those guys at <a href="http://appyentertainment.com/">Appy</a> paid my mortgage when I worked for them at High Moon Studios on Darkwatch.</p>

<p>Tune Runner is my favorite App product so far and a great example of a game obviously designed for the iPhone or iPad. Levels are generated from tunes that you buy or select from your own iPhone/iPad library. As the tune plays, you draw the shapes as they appear on the screen. And it&rsquo;s pretty.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve started taking a page from their book and started integrating photo and song selectors into my <a href="http://fugugames.com/">Fugu Games</a> using the Unity iPhone Enhancement Pack, though more as an afterthought. Shortly after I added a photo picker to Fugu Maze so you can set your own maze wall texture, sales increased ten-fold for a couple of weeks (and alas, dropped down again). With the vagaries of the App Store market, it&rsquo;s hard to tell if the new feature was responsible for the spike, but if it is, the Enhancement Pack has paid for itself. But I haven&rsquo;t tried it out on the iPad, yet, and I&rsquo;m waiting for at least one bug fix - the perils of juggling multiple middleware&hellip;</p>
