I get some nice emails and comments about my games, but this one I got today goes the farthest in the it’s-all-worth-it-even-if-I-don’t-make-a-dime category:

> I am a teacher of special ed students and have been looking for a good bowling game. Hyperbowl was requested by a student and he is sooo happy. He will work a whole day in a regular ed. classroom for just 10 minutes of hyperbowl. Thanks for the motivation reward!
