<p>I was planning to get FIOS in my new apartment, but despite Verizon touting no long-term contracts, every deal I looked at included a penalty for terminating before tywo years. I never hear good things about Comcast, but they are the other choice around here, they&rsquo;re month-to-month and cheaper. But they&rsquo;re not just cheaper, they&rsquo;re cheap. They try to save some bucks by mailing you the equipment for self-installation, which is great when it works, like my cable modem, but not when it doesn&rsquo;t, like my TV box. This is the part of the story where you end up on the phone with customer support going through the step-by-step troubleshooting-for-dummies procedure while thinking, I&rsquo;m an engineer, I can tell when a box is completely broken (the display always shows 0), and I didn&rsquo;t really want the TV service anyway, especially after I found out it provides about five channels.</p>

<p>The guy who they eventually sent out was cool - he took one look at the box, realized it was broken, handed me a new one, and said welcome to New Jersey (although you probably won&rsquo;t like it).</p>

<p>But that brings us up to the present, where I got a bill today with a &ldquo;reconnection fee&rdquo; coinciding with that visit. After travelling in circles on the Comcast site, I entered the customer support chat room. Initially, I thought I might be talking to a bot:</p>

<p>Toward the end, as things went downhill, I wished I was talking to a bot.</p>
