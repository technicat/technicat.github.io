<p>I released <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/app/fugu-maze/id295808255?mt=8">Fugu Maze</a> with full-screen iPad support last month. It showed up on the App Store on June 20. A lot has happened since then. For example, the iOS4 update was released on June 21. I suppose I should have upgraded immediately, but frankly, I barely noticed the release - I just saw some disparaging remarks about it on the Unity forums a few days later.</p>

<p>Anyway, I paid the price. I received mostly good reviews for this app update, but a few complaints that it was crashing. One user ranted that I was terrible and irresponsible and he was never going to buy anything from me in the future (never mind that he used a promo code), but at least he mentioned that he was running iOS4, and the light bulb finally switched on. The iOS4 announcement on the Apple site only mentioned support on the iPhone 3G and 3GS so for a moment I thought I might have to buy new hardware, or, gag, an AT&amp;T contract (they&rsquo;re on my you-owe-me-money list). But googling for iOS4 brought me onto another Apple page that explained it would run on my iPod touch, so I upgraded, watched my iPod touch grind to a halt, rebooted, found relief that it ran OK again, brought up Fugu Maze and reproduced the crash, narrowing it down to mp3 playbacks, a feature newly available in the Unity 3.0 beta and a bug discovered by others in the beta testing group, but alas, after I did.</p>

<p>Now I&rsquo;ve got another Fugu Maze update in the approval queue, with the mp3 audio replaced by uncompressed audio. And the OS upgrades are a one-way street, so now I&rsquo;m considering supporting only iOS4 (and iOS3.2 for the iPad) in the future, since I&rsquo;m not testing on older OS&rsquo;s, anymore. But fortunately, my other apps still run fine. So I&rsquo;ve got time to think&hellip;</p>
