<p>I received this notification from YouTube that a video I posted violated their guidelines and was removed. Seems to me they could be a bit friendlier about it (why close with &ldquo;sincerely&rdquo; if the message just reads like a parking ticket?) - no way to appeal, and not even a mention of which guideline was violated. I&rsquo;m guessing it was the CG nudity - the video was of a mocap demo using a sample provided by <a href="http://www.elektrashock.com/">ElektraShock.</a>
