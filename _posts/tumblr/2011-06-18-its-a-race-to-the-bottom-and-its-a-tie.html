<p>I&rsquo;m starting to feel like a social outcast by pricing <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/hyperbowl/id344209253?mt=8">HyperBowl on the App Store</a> at $2.99. Recent web reviews have been complimentary but have phrases like &ldquo;considering it&rsquo;s $2.99&hellip;&rdquo; (the same site also said a $.99 app was decent but is it worth $.99? ) At E3, someone I demoed HyperBowl to voiced surprise that I was pricing at $2.99. Then again, he claimed he had Angry Birds success after only paying a developer $5000.</p>

<p>Actually, I&rsquo;ve found $2.99 is more or less the revenue-maximizing price point for HyperBowl. $3.99 brings in about the same, maybe a bit more, but somehow $2.99 feels right (paradoxically, I might feel more justified in charging more if I dropped support for non-HD devices). My original plan was to charge $4.99 after I finished including all six of the original lanes, but I chickened out after one day of zero sales. I&rsquo;ve also charged $1.99 and $.99 for a few weeks at a time, but the increase in sales units doesn&rsquo;t compensate for the decrease in price. Perhaps this is short-sighted and I&rsquo;m targeting a local maximum, but staying at $.99 in the hopes of hitting a home run seems desperate, and I feel better about charging what seems fair to me. On the other hand, I didn&rsquo;t even try to charge more than $.99 for the <a href="https://market.android.com/details?id=com.technicat.HyperBowlPro">ad-free version of HyperBowl on the Android Market</a>. But maybe I should - I was surprised to see some users of the <a href="https://market.android.com/details?id=com.technicat.HyperBowl">ad-supported version</a> did upgrade.</p>

<p>I got some perspective a few weeks ago during lunch with a musician friend who is selling her music on iTunes. She thought my app sales were great in comparison. So I guess there&rsquo;s further down to go.</p>
