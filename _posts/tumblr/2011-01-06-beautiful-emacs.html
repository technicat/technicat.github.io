<p>For a long time, I edited my Unity scripts with Unitron, since that&rsquo;s the default Unity script editor. Then last year I switched to my longstanding preferred editor, Emacs, or rather the native MacOSX version, <a href="http://aquamacs.org/">Aquamacs</a>, using the <a href="http://blogs.unity3d.com/2010/01/15/emacs-mode-for-unity-javascript/">Unity-Emacs mode </a>supplied on the Unity blog. The cycle repeated with Unity 3 - I tried the new MonoDevelop support but my MacBook Pro starts chugging away when MonoDevelop starts up, so back to sleek and fast Aquamacs again.</p>

<p><a href="http://itshardtofondlepenguins.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Screen-shot-2011-01-04-at-11.24.32-PM.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4199" title="Screen shot 2011-01-04 at 11.24.32 PM" src="http://itshardtofondlepenguins.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Screen-shot-2011-01-04-at-11.24.32-PM.png" alt="" width="449" height="266"/></a></p>

<p>The amazing thing about this (besides calling Aquamacs sleek and fast - not a description that came up during old vi-vs.-emacs debates) is that I&rsquo;ve been using Emacs since 1985, or maybe even 1984 (&ldquo;Gee mister, did they have computers back then?&rdquo;) - but definitely in 1985 I was using Zmacs on Symbolics workstations, for programming, of course, but even writing short stories, my resume, and my bachelor thesis (using LaTex for nice formatting). As platforms came and went, I moved from Zmacs to Gnu Emacs, to XEmacs, to Aquamacs. Recently, I found myself bizarrely wishing for Emacs on an iPhone (or maybe an iPad - that doesn&rsquo;t sound so wrong, does it?)</p>

<p>Coincidentally, I picked up the book <a href="http://oreilly.com/catalog/9780596517984">Beautiful Architecture</a> this weekend and one of the more interesting chapters was on Emacs. I haven&rsquo;t finished the book, but I think I can safely generalize that the more interesting chapters are the ones written about real software projects. I also liked the one on Project Darkstar, and the one on Facebook is intriguing (although at points it seems like they&rsquo;re just taking standard web app diagrams and inserting a &ldquo;privacy&rdquo; block in them), and the academic ones are snoozers. Skip the first chapter - it&rsquo;s everything wrong with software engineering. Non-architect programmers aren&rsquo;t expected to understand the big picture and not even any single architect is expected to understand the entire product - &ldquo;conceptual integrity&rdquo; means proper application of design patterns and decomposition. Oh, sign me up for that project!</p>

<p>I think a big part of the problem is the word &ldquo;architecture&rdquo;. I used to like that analogy (in college, when I told my classmate, an architecture major that I wanted to be a computer architect, she said &ldquo;oh, great, we could really use some software&rdquo;), especially after reading Richard Gabriel&rsquo;s column in JOOP relating to (real) architect Christopher Alexander&rsquo;s design patterns, but then I moved to Silicon Valley, where everyone wanted to be a software architect, or senior software architect, or lead architect, and just having &ldquo;programmer&rdquo; as a job title was a disappointment (along with the corresponding stock options) Actually, everyone wanted to be CTO, but like the Highlander, there can only be one.</p>

<p>So it was a relief when I switched to the game industry and found that the desired title was &ldquo;lead programmer&rdquo;. Of course, there&rsquo;s a whole new set of hoighty-toighty titles I had to get used to. Game Designer. Art Director. Technical Director. Creative Director. I think job titles would be less ambiguous if they were suffixed with &ldquo;wannable&rdquo;, e.g. a lot of lead game programmers could be listed as &ldquo;John Carmack-wannabe&rdquo;. I&rsquo;ve worked for a &ldquo;Dave Perry wannabe&rdquo; and a &ldquo;Steve Jobs wannabe&rdquo;. But I have to admit clever job titles are appealing - in the very long credits for Tangled (was waiting to see a friend of mine listed and almost gave up), I saw a &ldquo;Caffeinator&rdquo;. Now, that&rsquo;s a job title we could all qualify for.</p>
