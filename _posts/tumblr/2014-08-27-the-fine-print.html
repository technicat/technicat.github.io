<p>The one thing I don&rsquo;t miss about California is my Time Warner Cable service. The telemarketing calls and door to door salesmen who start with the insincere &ldquo;How do you like your service?&rdquo; Grrr. But I can&rsquo;t get away from them. Their business cable unit seems to have bought the same email list as the other rinky dink business service outfits who&rsquo;ve been sending me spam, so I&rsquo;ve been getting regular invitations to buy TW business cable.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s like a big middle finger in my inbox every month, but I almost have to admire the obnoxiousness. Like &ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t reply to this email&rdquo; when a) it&rsquo;s spam, and b) there&rsquo;s no unsubscribe link. And then look at this fine print. A lot of it has to do with their Best Buy promotion (not an enticement for me - last time I signed up for a Best Buy promotion, I ended up paying for a Microsoft Internet account I never used). I do find the included social media links convenient, though. I went straight to their Facebook page to complain about the spam. What were they expecting, a Like?</p>
