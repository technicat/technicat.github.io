I first saw this fight scene at the Comic Con kung fu film showing. It was awesome, and I just saw the movie for the second time on Hulu Plus (can’t remember the first time I saw the film in its entirely, maybe a Redbox rental). Hulu streaming isn’t always kind to action scenes, but fortunately it wasn’t bad. Enjoy.
