I thought it wasn’t possible, but I started to feel sorry for Microsoft when their first “[I Am a PC](http://imapc.lifewithoutwalls.com/watch/)” commercials aired, starting with the [John Hodgman](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Hodgman) (PC guy in the [Apple ads](http://www.apple.com/getamac/ads/)) impersonator complaining, “I’m a PC, and I’m a stereotype.” Watching the rest of the ad is like watching nerds trying to be hip, or PC’s trying to be Macs. It might as well be a Mac ad.

Since then, I’ve noticed the self-pitying beginning has been dropped, and it seems to me the tone is a bit more aggressive (or am I the only one who sees “Up Yours” in “[Upload Yourself](http://imapc.lifewithoutwalls.com/)”?). And the guy who’s talking about pancakes - what’s that about?

As with the moral in John Hughes movies, Microsoft should stop being defensive and just be themselves - instead of trying to be one of the cool kids, they should take a poke at the turtleneck-wearing, goatee sporting “creative class” (who coined that term? talk about elitism).

For example, the PC-guy clone could take a swing at the Mac guy after yet another snide remark about Vista crashing. (Really, it’s pretty obvious the PC guy could take the Mac guy in an all-out fight, or maybe the don’t want to bring the DOJ into it again) And they could point out, “Yeah, Windows crashes a lot, but a lot of the money you gave us went to the [Gates Foundation](http://www.gatesfoundation.org/Pages/home.aspx) and is wiping out malaria and illiteracy. Where’s that yearly iPod expenditure going to?”

And the I-Am-a-PC videos are on [YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/user/WindowsVideos), so iPhone/iTouch users can watch. That’s a step in the right direction.
