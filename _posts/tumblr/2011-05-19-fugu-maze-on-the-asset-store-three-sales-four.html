<p>It&rsquo;s officially a trend - for the third month in a row, I&rsquo;ve sold one copy of <a href="http://u3d.as/content/technicat-llc/fugu-maze/1AT">Fugu Maze - The Project</a> on the Unity Asset Store.</p>

<p><a href="http://itshardtofondlepenguins.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Screen-shot-2011-05-19-at-6.04.10-AM.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4532" title="Screen shot 2011-05-19 at 6.04.10 AM" src="http://itshardtofondlepenguins.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Screen-shot-2011-05-19-at-6.04.10-AM.png" alt="" width="866" height="176"/></a></p>

<p>I&rsquo;m actually not disappointed. I was afraid the first sale in March might be a fluke. And better, it has a four-star rating (too bad the Asset Store doesn&rsquo;t tell me right now how many ratings there are)</p>

<p><a href="http://itshardtofondlepenguins.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Screen-shot-2011-05-19-at-6.26.04-AM.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4533" title="Screen shot 2011-05-19 at 6.26.04 AM" src="http://itshardtofondlepenguins.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Screen-shot-2011-05-19-at-6.26.04-AM.png" alt="" width="786" height="357"/></a></p>

<p>This was really my experimental foray into the Asset Store, but I think it should be a useful package (and potentially profitable - I&rsquo;ve made some money off the <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/app/fugu-maze/id295808255?mt=8">iOS version</a>, although some additional effort went into that adaptation and the <a href="https://market.android.com/details?id=com.technicat.FuguMaze">Android version</a>). You can put it together from scratch using the maze generation script I put on the wiki and Unity Standard Assets, but not everyone has an easy time doing that (it is a truism that if you offer a script to the community, someone will ask for a complete working project), and it demonstrates some common how-do-I-do-this features requested on the Unity forum, like footstep sounds, flashlight effect, and a pause menu (also on the wiki).</p>



<p>Now I&rsquo;m thinking I should have included the project variation that displays a video texture on the maze wall (it&rsquo;s trippy, especially when I used the John McCain greenscreen movie). Hmm, maybe I&rsquo;ll make an update&hellip;and I always thought an Editor script version would be useful&hellip;</p>
