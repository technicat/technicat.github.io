<p>My favorite charity at this very moment is <a href="http://amnestyusa.org/">Amnesty International</a>. Just because in a recent mail solicitation from them, I saw something I&rsquo;ve never seen before - a check-box to opt out of their address-sharing program. To make sure I wasn&rsquo;t imagining it, I checked their web site and it&rsquo;s there, too:

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1846" title="picture-5" src="http://itshardtofondlepenguins.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/picture-5.png" alt="picture-5" width="521" height="271"/>

Coincidentally, this arrived shortly after I complained to the <a href="http://aclu.org/">ACLU</a> about their address-sharing program. They also have an opt-out option - the inconvenient kind, where you have to write in. As with commercial enterprises that make money by renting or selling your address, this is par for the course for non-profits, although <a href="http://charitynavigator.org/">Charity Navigator</a> does use it as a rating criterion. With the ACLU, it seems a bit hyprocritical, considering their stances on consumer privacy in areas such as medical patient databases. Their privacy statement (and a blurb in their newsletters) reassures:
</p><blockquote>We may also share the Voluntarily Submitted Data of members and donors who are U.S. residents with other non-profit organizations and publications (&ldquo;Sharing Organizations&rdquo;), but never to any partisan political groups or to groups whose programs are incompatible with ACLU policies. </blockquote>
But that&rsquo;s terribly vague. For example, at one point during the presidential election I found that <a href="http://moveon.org/">MoveOn</a> described itself as &ldquo;non-partisan&rdquo; on its web site and yet had a Top Ten Things You Should Know About John McCain article that included a factoid that McCain was one of the richest members of Congress, failing to  note (besides &ldquo;so what&rdquo;) that several Democrats were ahead of him on that <a href="http://www.rollcall.com/features/Guide-to-Congress_2008/guide/28506-1.html">list</a>, including John Kerry and Ted Kennedy (and Jay Rockefeller, no surprise).
