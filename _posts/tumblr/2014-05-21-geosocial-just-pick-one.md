I recently did some reading up on “geosocial” apps, and I think it’s just a bad term. Every geosocial app I can think of is really a geolocation app that added social features or a social app that has added geolocation features. Facebook and twitter are obviously social apps - you can tell because the main interface is the social feed. They both have geolocation features, but those features really aren’t important and as far as I can tell, no one really cares.

For example,the twitter use of lcoation is minimal, and although Facebook would also like to be Foursquare (and every other social app), the primary interaction with Facebook is still posting, liking, sharing and giving up privacy.

Fousquare, on the other hand, is a geolocation app. It’s hard to tell, because instead of presenting a map, the main screen is a mishmash of social activity that can’t possibly be of interest (that realtor who followed you checked into a Burger King in another town), along with a half-assed attempt at guessing where you might want to check in. The only useful GUI on that screen is the checkin button, and even the resulting popup list of suggested locations with estimated distances is just crying out for a map.

The map is just about the best and most efficitinet visual data presentation that history has produced, and with Google Maps and the like, they can be interactive interfaces. So Foursquare, stop trying to be social. You’re a geo app, so just show me where I am!
