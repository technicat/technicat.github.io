<p>In the entertainment industry, we should remind ourselves what we&rsquo;re doing isn&rsquo;t all that important (hey, get over yourselves!). Sure, some people create visual masterpieces and hours of enjoyment, but then again, there are those who can&rsquo;t even see. That&rsquo;s where <a href="http://web.mit.edu/bcs/sinha/prakash.html">Project Prakash</a>, started by my friend <a href="http://web.mit.edu/bcs/sinha/home.html">Pawan Sinha</a> at MIT, comes in.</p>
