The most-played game on my iPod touch is…Scrabble. It’s got a lot going for it: a polished look (e.g. the nice animated screen while it’s loading, although I don’t understand why the load time is so long), the original game is fun (I played against the computer three times on the day I bought the app), but what makes it a near-daily play for me is the Facebook connection - I play regularly against one of my high school classmates.

At $2.99, it’s reasonably priced. But the iPad version is $9.99, which is why it’s not going to qualify as the most-played game on my iPad.
