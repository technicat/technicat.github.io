I was planning to get FIOS in my new apartment, but despite Verizon touting no long-term contracts, every deal I looked at included a penalty for terminating before tywo years. I never hear good things about Comcast, but they are the other choice around here, they’re month-to-month and cheaper. But they’re not just cheaper, they’re cheap. They try to save some bucks by mailing you the equipment for self-installation, which is great when it works, like my cable modem, but not when it doesn’t, like my TV box. This is the part of the story where you end up on the phone with customer support going through the step-by-step troubleshooting-for-dummies procedure while thinking, I’m an engineer, I can tell when a box is completely broken (the display always shows 0), and I didn’t really want the TV service anyway, especially after I found out it provides about five channels.

The guy who they eventually sent out was cool - he took one look at the box, realized it was broken, handed me a new one, and said welcome to New Jersey (although you probably won’t like it).

But that brings us up to the present, where I got a bill today with a “reconnection fee” coinciding with that visit. After travelling in circles on the Comcast site, I entered the customer support chat room. Initially, I thought I might be talking to a bot:

Toward the end, as things went downhill, I wished I was talking to a bot.
