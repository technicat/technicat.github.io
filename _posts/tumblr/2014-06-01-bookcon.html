<p>Now that I&rsquo;m on the East Coast, I&rsquo;m giving up easy access to E3, GDC, Comic Con&hellip;but according to the BookCon web site, New York is the &ldquo;publishing and cultural capital of the world&rdquo; so I attended that this weekend. And you know what, just as said bookstores were my favorite places to hang out, I found it easy to kill five hours just looking at books. And apparently, so do my nephews - here they are getting an early start before the  show opened:</p>
