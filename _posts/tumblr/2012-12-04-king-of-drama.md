The best currently-running Korean drama is King of Drama, a drama about making dramas. It’s not a melodrama, thankfully, it’s quite satirical, a bit like Broadcast News, and very meta. I’ve been wondering how the actors in these dramas manage to cry so much - here the guy fakes it with a little drool.
