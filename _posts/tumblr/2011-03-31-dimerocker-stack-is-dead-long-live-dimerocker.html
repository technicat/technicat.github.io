<p>I only noticed today that my version of HyperBowl on dimeRocker Stack - the first incarnation of the dimeRocker Facebook platform, is no longer running, so I got to try out the Facebook remove-your-app functionality. I reviewed the announcements on the dimeRocker <a href="http://developer.dimerocker.com/">developer forums</a> and saw that Stack was scheduled to shut down on March 1, replaced by the dimeRocker Arcade (<a href="http://apps.facebook.com/dimerocker/play/hyperbowl">HyperBowl</a> is already on it) Here&rsquo;s hoping the Arcade lives longer!</p>
