<p><a href="http://itunes.apple.com/app/hyperbowl/id344209253?mt=8">HyperBowl 1.6</a> was approved on the App Store today. I was getting a bit worried since I submitted it a week ago, and approvals this year have mostly taken three days or less. But subtracting Memorial Day weekend, I guess this still only took four business days.</p>

<p>In any case, I was a bit anxious to get this update out since the previous release was the first one with native iPad support, and I belatedly realized that if you swiped vigorously on the iPad screen you could exceed the limits of the physics system, i.e. roll the ball at high speeds through a wall. As far as I know, no one&rsquo;s done that, but in any case, I tweaked the controls to compensate for the larger screen and added a speed limit for the ball.</p>

<p>This release is also the first one featuring High Seas, the fourth HyperBowl lane. It&rsquo;s defining feature is a rocking ship as the bowling platform, but the physics cost means the lane is not active on the iPhone (I tried playing it at 10fps - not fun). I&rsquo;ll probably enable for the iPhone in the next update but with the rocking turned off. Won&rsquo;t be the same, but at least iPhone users will be able to play it.</p>
