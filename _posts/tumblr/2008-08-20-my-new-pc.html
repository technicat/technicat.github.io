<p>I like my 1994 Toyota Celica, the way it looks, the way it handles, and, especially these days, the 30mpg. And it makes fiscal sense to keep driving it as long as it&rsquo;s running fine (the folks at my local Jiffy Lube tell me it should run for another 150k miles).</p>

<p>But the biggest reason I haven&rsquo;t traded it in for something sporty and new and with power windows is that I dread going into a car dealership. It&rsquo;s a good thing Toyota&rsquo;s are so reliable because every Toyota dealership I&rsquo;ve visited while trying to buy one was a cesspool of <a href="http://www.edmunds.com/advice/buying/articles/42962/page001.html">slimy sales tactics</a>. I purchased my first one, a Tercel, my very first car, from the lying liars at Toyota of Irving after visiting the lying liars at every other Toyota dealership in the Dallas area (my favorite trick - a dealer who offered my more savvy friends tickets to a movie so he could deal with me alone). And when the Tercel sprung an oil leak after eight years of valiant service, I spent three hours at Mike Miller Toyota of Culver City asking them to return my drivers license while they sent three different salesmen at me to haggle (which backfired - they got confused about the state of the negotiation and unilaterally lowered their offer). Adding insult to injury - both my Toyota&rsquo;s sported pinstriping, added as a dealer option to the invoice.</p>

<p>You&rsquo;d think computers are new school enough that buying a new PC would be at the other end of the spectrum in sales experience, but, at least when buying from retail, I find myself trying to choose which will be the least distasteful place to buy from. At least two computers I bought from Fry&rsquo;s turned out to have been customer returns (the first was obvious after I set it up and found it was in the middle of a ten floppy-disk OS install and the registration form was partly filled out - for the second one, the guy told me it was open but not a return, I said really that&rsquo;s not what happened last time, and then he said let me check oh yeah it&rsquo;s a return) Best Buy pushed really hard on selling me an extended warranty and then signed me up for Microsoft&rsquo;s online service which dutifully started charging me automatically from the same credit card (too bad I missed out on the <a href="http://articles.latimes.com/2007/oct/16/business/fi-micro16">class action suit</a>). CompUSA also pushed extended warranties to an annoying extent but at least I never ended up with a used product or credit card charges for an online service I didn&rsquo;t even have a login for, so  I stuck with them until they went out of business.</p>

<p>Alas, I can&rsquo;t hold out for eight to twelve years between PC upgrades. In fact, tracking <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore's_law">Moore&rsquo;s Law</a>, only a year and a half since my last PC purchase, I decided for work I needed to get one of the many new 64-bit Windows systems.</p>

<p>First stop, Circuit City - I often by DVD&rsquo;s there, but hanging around the PC section the most attention I got was from a roving salesperson pushing some all-in-one broadband package, I think. And they didn&rsquo;t have much selection among high-end systems (although more are listed on the web site).</p>

<p>So I took a longer drive to <a href="http://microcenter.com/">Micro Center</a> - the closest thing to Fry&rsquo;s without being Fry&rsquo;s. A bit of nostalgia - I used to frequent the one in Cambridge and bought my earliest computers there (one of the cool early <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PowerBook">Powerbooks</a> - c'mon give <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Sculley">Sculley</a> some credit, and the Mac with a PC card in it). There, a friendly salesperson who was also studying to be a financial adviser steered me to a <a href="http://powerspec.com/">PowerSpec</a> (after giving me some free financial advice). PowerSpec which is essentially a house brand of Micro Center, so they have some on-site support in addition to web support. It&rsquo;s a value buy, but to an annoying extent - open the box, and there are no cables. OK, I can see not providing a video cable, but no power cable? C'mon. And while the box says it&rsquo;s &ldquo;downgradeable to Windows XP&rdquo; because everyone hates Vista, that actually means it has XP installed and is upgradeable to Vista. And since I needed 64-bit Vista for work and not 32-bit XP (and the 4GB of installed memory isn&rsquo;t even fully usable by 32-bit Windows), I needed to upgrade. But, like the cables, no Vista, just a desktop shortcut saying contact the support web site. Chose the email support option, response was &ldquo;the disk is included with the computer&rdquo;. Tried live chat, same response, but in real time you get to argue, so the advice was amended to a terse &ldquo;you should return it&rdquo; and &ldquo;a few PC&rsquo;s were shipped without the disk&rdquo;.</p>

<p>So I did what I should have done the first time - checked the specs of all potentially interesting PC&rsquo;s listed on the Micro Center web site, went back and traded in that PowerSpec waste of a box for an HP model, didn&rsquo;t bother asking for a salesperson&rsquo;s recommendation, said no a few times to the extended warranty, and now I have a pretty cool 8GB 64-bit Vista PC that has the latest graphics card you can get for under $2k (no way I&rsquo;m paying $3500 for a water-cooled dual graphics card <a href="http://h20435.www2.hp.com/#/HOME">Blackbird</a>). It does a passable job playing <a href="http://www.ea.com/crysis/">Crysis</a> (nothing yet does a great job). And there&rsquo;s no pinstriping.<br/><a href="http://itshardtofondlepenguins.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/img_0837.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-524" title="img_0837" src="http://itshardtofondlepenguins.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/img_0837.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="375"/></a></p>
