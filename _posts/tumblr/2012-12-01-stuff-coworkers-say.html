<p>I was just thinking of something one of my coworkers said on my first day of my first salaried job. Upon hearing that I just got out of MIT, he informed me that &ldquo;I would have gone to MIT if I&rsquo;d known about it.&rdquo; Yup, that&rsquo;s what the admissions brochure says - &ldquo;If you heard of us, you&rsquo;re in.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The workplace is an environment where you&rsquo;re stuck listening to comments that you can&rsquo;t ignore. Much like the Internet. Anyway, here are a few other doozies that I can remember:</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the Traveling Salesman Problem.&rdquo; Funny when that&rsquo;s the label applied to every problem that can&rsquo;t be solve in linear time.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;ll be done tomorrow.&rdquo; Funny when it&rsquo;s said at every weekly meeting for three months.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a Sun bug.&rdquo; Funny when it&rsquo;s not.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the only person who had a problem with me.&rdquo; Funny when it&rsquo;s not.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I love Asian women.&rdquo; OK, that was an interview candidate, but I had to mention that one.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The product&rsquo;s released already?&rdquo; Yup.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So how much are you getting paid?&rdquo; There&rsquo;s no way this question ends well.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll release the product when it&rsquo;s ready.&rdquo; Famous last words.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, we&rsquo;ll take care of you.&rdquo; Management.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you hear Rush Limbaugh this morning? He was great!&rdquo; Argh.</p>

<p>&ldquo;America was founded as a Christian nation.&rdquo; Not so funny considering the guy was trying to make conversation while I was working crunch time with the flu. I could have mentioned that separation-of-church-and-state thing, or that hey, atheist with Muslim ancestors sitting here, or hey, Jewish coworker sitting right there, or hey, you&rsquo;re Catholic and we could just as easily say this is a Protestant country. Or I could have just coughed on him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have a patent for laser printers.&rdquo; Liar.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was an RAF pilot.&rdquo; Pants on fire.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s easy. I can get it done in a couple of days.&rdquo; Lie, but not intentional.</p>
