Here’s all the money I’ve made from writing, from Epinions (not counting the video game dialogue I wrote eight years ago, although I don’t remember if that was during the paid or unpaid portion of that contract). Anyway, you can see I started when Epinions was handing out ten and twenty dollar bonuses for prolific reviewers and there was a management change (or two), and now they’re more likely to take away earnings for not logging in enough.
