<p>I decided to try putting <a href="http://hyperbowl3d.com/">HyperBowl</a> on some web game portals. Only a few support <a href="http://unity3d.com/">Unity</a> right now, but the number is growing. On opposite sides of the spectrum, <a href="http://unicade.unifycommunity.com/">Unicade</a> was one of the first but doesn&rsquo;t do any ad-revenue sharing and it&rsquo;s hard to tell if it&rsquo;s maintained, anymore. <a href="http://shockwave.com/">Shockwave</a> also featured a Unity game early on, but they&rsquo;re submission process is like, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll get back to you.&rdquo; <a href="http://editoriald.com/">EditorialD</a> is the new kid on the block, but it seems like they&rsquo;re still figuring things out.</p>

<p>So I settled on <a href="http://gamejolt.com/online/games/action/hyperbowl-classic/1091/">GameJolt</a> and <a href="http://www.wooglie.com/playgame.php?gameID=123">Wooglie</a> for now. They both feature convenient developer account registration and game uploads. GameJolt is a bit more inviting - there&rsquo;s no wait for approval and they explicitly invite works-in-progress. Wooglie doesn&rsquo;t show your game until it&rsquo;s approved, although the approval takes place quickly, and they just introduced a work-in-progress category. Both have nice displays of your current income generated, which is a lot more reassuring than just trusting someone to pay you according to some hidden numbers.</p>

<p>GameJolt is more polished, even though the site says &ldquo;beta&rdquo; - it has a nice clean look, even with ads, and developer-friendly features like video uploading and a news section for each game. Wooglie looks a bit more like your typical ad-crammed site and could use some refinement - the comment field is just one line and I saw a web-server error embedded in there at one point. Wooglie also has a slower web player load time (it&rsquo;s not too bad, at least it lets me test the load-progress display on my web player!). On GameJolt for some reason, my logo display seems a little stuttery.</p>

<p>GameJolt seems to have a lot more traffic, but the downside is you have to compete with a lot of games, mostly non-Unity, and after you submit a game, it get buried pretty fast. Wooglie is Unity-only, so if you submit right now, chances are you&rsquo;ll show up on the front page.</p>
