<p>I&rsquo;m wondering if Facebook has hit the wall.</p>

<p>First, there was that redesign. I can&rsquo;t say that the new look is worse, but then again, I can&rsquo;t say it&rsquo;s better. It&rsquo;s like a corporate reorg - it gives you the sense that progress is being made, but perhaps my senses deceive me.</p>

<p>More disturbing, it&rsquo;s been really slow, lately. My browser status icon is spinning&hellip;spinning, just to show a page. Have they run into scalability issues? Web 2.0 success can be an enemy when it comes to scalability. That&rsquo;s what likely doomed Friendster and almost totalled eBay (remember that crash back around 1999 where they had so much traffic they couldn&rsquo;t restart the server and keep it going?)</p>

<p>And then you have to wonder if they still have the crack staff that made them successful in the first place. Besides the performance, there&rsquo;s some other glitchiness. For a while, icons didn&rsquo;t show upÂ  - when I checked Help it was listed as known issue for a few people but solved (sounds like a political coverup). When I saw that Safari didn&rsquo;t have that problem I switched to that browser, but then I spent a lot of time in my product page hitting the Share status button before figuring out it was only stuck on Safari (is this the Microsoft investment at work?) Back to Firefox and now the icons work.</p>

<p>OK, those are all programming glitches, and at least Facebook has a nice clean look - a big attraction for me over the tackiness of MySpace. But maybe they&rsquo;ve lost their best designers, too. I spent an inordinate amount of time choosing an icon for my product page not based on the appearance of the icon itself, but according to which one is cropped the least badly by Facebook. A wide image will have both sides cropped in the main display. Fair enough. But if I pick one that fits OK there, it is cropped vertically in the thumnail display - a problem partially addressed by allowing you to &ldquo;edit&rdquo; a thumbnail by dragging it around so it crops with the least amount of damage.</p>

<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2069" title="picture-10" src="http://itshardtofondlepenguins.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/picture-10.png" alt="picture-10" width="789" height="268"/></p>

<p>And after all that, in the Highlights display it is cropped even more.</p>

<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2070" title="picture-9" src="http://itshardtofondlepenguins.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/picture-9.png" alt="picture-9" width="268" height="82"/></p>

<p>You&rsquo;ve got to be kidding me. Did they lose their best designers, too? Actually, who would think that displaying the same image with three different aspect ratios and randomly cropping to compensate would look good? Just pick a square!</p>
