<p>When my nephew said &ldquo;I love useless creations,&rdquo; I thought he was saying something profound about app design. Turns out he was talking about this AR app, Dinosaurs Everywhere, from Useless Creations. Just goes to show a little bit of AR and a few dinosaurs can go a long way - all this app does is show dinosaurs walking around.</p>
