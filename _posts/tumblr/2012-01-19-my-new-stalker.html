<p>Last it year it was Time-Warner stalking me on the phone with daily telemarketers showing fake interest in my current service as a pretext for pushing more bundles on me. Now it&rsquo;s Blue Shield - in the past two months, they&rsquo;ve regularly been leaving robocall messages on my phone saying I need to call them up with a seven digit code (oh, yeah, I memorize them all the time) to hear important benefits information, which turn out to be more recordings which are barely above the level of &ldquo;don&rsquo;t get sick&rdquo;. It makes me almost nostalgic for the Time-Warner calls, who at least were human and had the decency to rudely not leave a message.

I don&rsquo;t like uncivil discourse on the web, but this type of thing brings out the uncivil in me, so I dashed off the following on their web site (under &ldquo;benefits&rdquo; - they don&rsquo;t actually a category for general complaints or inquiries). I normally draw the line at swearing - I reserve that for programming - but I almost crossed it this time.
</p><blockquote>Can you stop robocalling messages that just tell me to call for important benefits information with a seven digit code (so that I have to listen to the message multiple times to write it down), only to find another recorded message with tips like don&rsquo;t go to the emergency room unnecessarily, tips that you could have just mailed me. It is a really obnoxious practice that doesn&rsquo;t make the health insurance industry look any better, and I wonder what moron thought that was a good idea. That number is my cell phone and registered on the federal do-not-call list, so it should be illegal, too.</blockquote>
Meanwhile, they&rsquo;ve refrained from increasing premiums yearly due to the threat of action by the state (and this is a non-profit insurer!), and they keep asking me to participate in a survey to help them choose new plan names. Yipee! Fun! Seriously, morons.
