<p>On my Cathay Pacific flight back to California from Hong Kong, for some reason I was asked to fill out a survey. Maybe they guessed I was in a non-complaining mood. And they guessed right - I basically wrote down that the cabin crew was awesome.

I was being honest, although in that situation I don&rsquo;t know if I would have felt comfortable complaining. A sealable envelope was provided, but I figure if I had nasty comments and sealed them, they would have been suspicious, and if I left it unsealed, they might read it, and boy, that could have been uncomfortable. And indeed they did read my comments, for right afterwards, one of the crew members stopped by to thank me. And I also received this email today:

</p><blockquote>We are delighted to hear
that you enjoyed your recent experience and we will be happy to pass on
your kind words to the staff concerned.

We tend to hear from our customers when they encounter problems, so your
kind compliments, especially from our valued loyalty customers make a
welcoming change!

Thank you again and we look forward to serving you again soon.</blockquote>

See, it&rsquo;s not just us indie developers who like a kind word. Airlines have feelings, too! And by the way, on my return flight to Hong Kong, one more meal before landing would have hit the spot. A little dim sum, maybe. I&rsquo;m not complaining, just saying&hellip;
