<p>I was content to use one of the presupplied themes for my <a href="http://twitter.com/fugugames">twitter account</a>, unti I saw a twitter profile page with a photo as the background. I thought, that&rsquo;s lame, I can do a better job. After trying out various layouts that didn&rsquo;t squash or stretch properly or blend nicely with the content area, I climbed back into my graphic design comfort zone and just used one of my beach photos.</p>
