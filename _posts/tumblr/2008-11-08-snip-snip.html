<p>I finally found one thing I like about Windows Vista - the <a href="http://lifehacker.com/software/windows-vista/windows-vista-tip--take-screenshots-with-the-snipping-tool-228885.php">Snipping Tool</a>.Â  On XP, <a href="http://www.techsmith.com/">SnagIt</a> was a big help for window snapshots, but I lost my license key and the trial version I installed on Vista kept popping up every day with a friendly reminder &ldquo;30 days until trial expiration&rdquo;, &ldquo;29 days until trial expiration&rdquo;, and so on&hellip;After 30 days, I never wanted to see the SnagIt window again, so a Google search turned up what was sitting under my Accessories menu all along (it gives you an option to place a shortcut on the system tray, but it really should be there from the start.</p>

<p>The Mac already has an adequate window capture facility, but I found <a href="http://www.ambrosiasw.com/utilities/snapzprox/">SnapZ ProX</a> an improvement, with conveniences like specifying exact pixel dimensions of the capture. That&rsquo;s a bonus, since I purchased the product for video capture (though in the odd world of software, I really purchased a license to use the software).</p>

<p>I wasn&rsquo;t happy this time around to find after a long test capture that the updated trial I downloaded this time added a watermark (without any indication that it was going to do so), and I had to redo it after purchasing the license. I might have gone with one of the alternatives I&rsquo;ve seen recommended, like the much cheaper <a href="http://store.shinywhitebox.com/home/home.html">IShowU</a>, but I&rsquo;m not <a href="http://walt.allthingsd.com/">Walt Mossberg</a> - I don&rsquo;t have time to try out every single one - and I&rsquo;d used a previous trial of SnapZ ProX to successfully create a video. That installation was probably time-restricted but didn&rsquo;t mar the result in any way. First impressions count!</p>

<p>I still need to figure out the performance limits of the SnapZ ProX on my (somewhat aged) MacBook Pro. I was overly ambitious with the quality settings on this first attempt with this setup - it&rsquo;s pretty glitchy, and my manual &ldquo;camera work&rdquo; would be better replaced by a canned camera sequence:</p>
