I’ve complained a lot about the terms of service on various web sites, in particular review sites, and my one recourse (besides ranting fruitlessly on their discussion pages), is to just write reviews on my own blog. I lose out on a larger audience, but in practice, I don’t really have time to write all over the place, anyway. I just discovered one of my complaints about the Epinions TOS has come to fruition - their stated policy of deactivating idle accounts. I tried to log into my account today and had to reactivate it. To add insult to injury, they removed all five dollars of my unredeemed earnings.

> **Thank you** Your account has been reactivated. **Please note:** Since your account was deactivated any unredeemed Eroyalties were removed. However, your account maintains the same ID, password, reviews, and comments. Your Epinions account was deactivated because you had not logged into your account in over four months. If you have any questions please refer to the [User Agreement](http://www.epinions.com/help/show_%7Euseragreement) or contact [Community Care](http://www.epinions.com/help/feedback_general.html).

I had already started copying my Epinion reviews that I thought worth reprinting onto this blog. Now, at the risk of sounding petulant (and of reprinting some less readable reviews), I’m going to finish the job and delete them from Epinions. Two can play at the deactivation game!
