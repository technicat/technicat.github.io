A few weeks ago I received a rejection letter from Steam for [HyperBowl](http://hyperbowl3d.com/). Of course, no one likes to get rejected, but, at the risk of sounding like sour grapes, it’s kind of a relief. I prefer to concentrate on mobile apps for both technical and business reasons, and it’s just more fun.

I like targeting devices with fixed hardware specs rather than waiting for complaint involving mystery PC/GPU/OS configurations (often when I ask someone to report that information, all I get is “Windows”), and Apple set the bar with the App Store, with a low barrier of entry ($99 yearly, compared to the $1000/submission Motorola charged when I wanted to get into mobile with J2ME apps years ago), a transparent business arrangement (70/30, which is now standard), and published acceptance guidelines (although there’s enough generality there they can pretty much reject anything they want).

In addition, there are the multiple app markets available on Android, with various quirks and features of their own (Amazon and Appia, formerly Handango, have some obnoxious pricing controls), but there is a world of difference between them and the desktop market. Everything about Steam is confidential - the revenue share, technical requirements, even the rejection letter I got said it wasn’t their policy to disclose the reason for the rejections. And it’s not just Steam - go to any PC/Mac publisher site, even indies, and it’s “contact us” vs. “sign up, and upload your apps!” (I did have high hopes for the Mac App Store, but after they rejected HyperBowl because of other versions - “It’s been repurposed too much”, I think they need an attitude adjustment)

Now, there are plenty who complain unrestricted self-publishing leads to app stores crowded with mediocrity, but I think any of them will change their tune as soon as they have their own apps rejected (no one thinks their own baby is ugly). Try working on a game project where you have to go through a traditional publisher to access the distribution channel and your livelihood (and often your IP) lies in their hands. Then you’ll appreciate the “self” in self-publishing.
