<p>I&rsquo;m amazed that during talk of mortgage relief and the housing meltdown, scurrilous mortgage lenders are still operating.<!--more--></p>

<p>The most recent one I received had urgency written all over the envelope</p>

<p><a href="http://itshardtofondlepenguins.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/picture-3.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-164" title="picture-3" src="http://itshardtofondlepenguins.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/picture-3.png" alt="" width="500" height="37"/></a></p>

<p>and a generic company name that sounds like it might be affiliated with my original lender</p>

<p><a href="http://itshardtofondlepenguins.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/picture-2.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-162" title="picture-2" src="http://itshardtofondlepenguins.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/picture-2.png" alt="" width="257" height="51"/></a></p>

<p>promises of lowering my payments</p>

<p><a href="http://itshardtofondlepenguins.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/picture-11.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-160" title="picture-11" src="http://itshardtofondlepenguins.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/picture-11.png" alt="" width="500" height="74"/></a></p>

<p>and even cash back!</p>

<p><a href="http://itshardtofondlepenguins.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/picture-4.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-159" title="picture-4" src="http://itshardtofondlepenguins.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/picture-4.png" alt="" width="500" height="189"/></a></p>

<p>and finally, the fine print at bottom indicating that this is an interest-only loan, and they&rsquo;re not really affiliated with the original mortgate lender</p>

<p><a href="http://itshardtofondlepenguins.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/picture-51.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-163" title="picture-51" src="http://itshardtofondlepenguins.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/picture-51.png" alt="" width="500" height="50"/></a></p>

<p>This is actually one of the less blatantly misleading solicitations I&rsquo;ve seen. Most have my original lender&rsquo;s name plastered on the envelope and letter, and one had the word &ldquo;Federal&rdquo; in its company name along with a logo that resembled that of a government agency, and fine print stating it wasn&rsquo;t a federal agency. If anyone deserves to get kicked out of their homes, it&rsquo;s these guys.</p>
