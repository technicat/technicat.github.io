<p>I&rsquo;ve heard that South Korea has great broadband speed, especially compared to the US, and that&rsquo;s been my experience from my one trip to Korea that I just returned from. Here&rsquo;s the Speedtest result from my hotel near the Incheon airport. Check out that upload speed!</p>

<p>The results from my hotel near the San Francisco airport don&rsquo;t look that much worse, as long as you&rsquo;re just downloading. But uploading sucks (as I just verified with an app submission).</p>

<p>But both cases are way better than Hong Kong.</p>
