Well, this brings back memories. I was going to reminisce about how the C64 was one of the first computers I learned to program, but I think it was actually the Commodore PET and typing in a Star Trek BASIC game while watching the cassette deck get stuck in the Iowa summer heat doesn’t really qualify as programming. Nonetheless, this looks cool. What are the chances we’ll see an Apple II on the iPhone?
