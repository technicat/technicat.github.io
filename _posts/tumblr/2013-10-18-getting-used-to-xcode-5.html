<p>Since I use Unity for iOS dev, I don&rsquo;t need to spend much time in Xcode, but there were still enough changes in Xcode 5 to cause a bit of confusion when it came to making distribution builds. At first, I couldn&rsquo;t find where to change the provisioning profile for release builds. After a brief panic, selecting All and Levels, instead of Basic and Combined, gave me what I was used to seeing in the Build Settings. The other quirk is that performing the Build then complains that it can&rsquo;t find a matching provisioning profile for my attached iOS device. The workaround is to just disconnect the device before performing the Build.</p>
