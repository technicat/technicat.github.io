<p>Much has been made about the irony of California&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.voterguide.sos.ca.gov/title-sum/prop8-title-sum.htm">Proposition 8</a> passing in a year when Barack Obama has been elected President, in particular the support of black voters for the bill banning gay marriage. Indeed, while I recall seeing an Obama ad opposing the bill (and more memorably, a Samuel Jackson narrated piece pointing out the history of racially discriminatory laws in California including a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miscegenation">miscegenation</a> ban that was cited heavily during the State Supreme court arguments on this issue), the <a href="http://naacp.org/">NAACP</a> and <a href="http://nul.org/">National Urban League</a> web sites make no mention of the it (I checked those two because they&rsquo;ve been sending me donation mail since I used my credit card reward points on an <a href="http://www.americanlegacymag.com/">American Legacy</a> subscription).</p>

<p>But I imagine outside of San Francisco and Hollywood, the majority of most groups in this state voted for it (I live in Orange County, which is often accompanied by the words &ldquo;republican stronghold&rdquo;) The <a href="http://askamexican.org/">Ask A Mexican</a> columnist of the OC Weekly lamented the attitude of traditional Latinos on this issue and urged them to vote against the bill. I don&rsquo;t know about the official stance of Asian American groups, but this does remind me of an Asian American conference I attended in Boston years ago, in which, after a young woman brought up the issue of gay rights, the guy next to me remarked, &ldquo;Did you see that lesbian?&rdquo; Even <a href="http://moveon.org/">MoveOn</a> doesn&rsquo;t have anything to say - and they&rsquo;re based in California.</p>

<p>What surprises me is that that the proposition passed after such lame TV ads - there was the one showing San Francisco Mayor <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gavin_Newsom">Gary Newsom</a> apparently saying gay marriage is &ldquo;here to say whether you like it or not&rdquo; in an apparently gay manner (although he&rsquo;s had enough marriages, girlfriends and notorious affairs to earn himself a heterosexual medal of honor), and then the one claiming that without the bill, gay marriage will be taught to schoolchildren, and then, after opponents responded with a &ldquo;no it won&rsquo;t&rdquo; ad, an ad saying &ldquo;yes it will&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Now, I went through the public school system in California (fifth through half of ninth grade), and if I&rsquo;d been taught about gay marriage, that would probably have doubled what I learned in school. I learned to read proficiently from my parents and the public library. And also from the library I learned about atoms (from a book by Isaac Asimov), the life of Muhammad Ali, how murderous plants will take over the Earth if everyone went blind (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Day_of_the_Triffids">Day of the Triffids</a>), and legal procedure in murder cases (Perry Mason mysteries). And my parents taught me to type, which turned out to be surprisingly useful (nothing pains me like watching a $90,000/year programmer hunt-and-peck on the keyboard).</p>

<p>I learned how to write with metaphors in sixth grade after another student wrote an imaginative story and received glowing comments from the teacher, so I just copied his style (I guess I learned to plagiarize at that same time). In the same class, I learned how to diagram sentences by drawing random lines around them, since the teachers received an activity packet that included that activity, but didn&rsquo;t know to diagram sentences themselves. I did enjoy reading boxes of cards with interesting stories - I think they were called SRI cards or something like that.</p>

<p>In junior high, I learned algebra, which turned out to be useful. I discovered computers in the form of a TRS-80 in the school library, but I confess my first question  was &ldquo;what&rsquo;s it good for&rdquo;, and I only used it to repeatedly type in the same BASIC program from a magazine every day until the librarian showed me the cassette deck. (I learned to program after transferring to a school in Iowa that had an Apple II in their  library). I might have learned some science in school if they hadn&rsquo;t replaced the veteran science teacher with a new grad who didn&rsquo;t know any science (my classmates, smelling blood in the water, urged me to &ldquo;ask her questions she can&rsquo;t answer!&rdquo;) I learned how to suck up to the boss, after I approached an English teacher after class to point out a mistake in grading - the next day, she publicly praised me for the &ldquo;correct&rdquo; way I handled the situation without embarassing her and urged everyone to follow my example. She also blamed the Latino kid for misgrading my paper (actually telling me &ldquo;he&rsquo;s not going to make it in this class&rdquo;), so I also learned about racism (actually, that was my second lesson - they had placed me in the remedial English and math classes, even though I&rsquo;d entered the district spelling bee in my previous school). I learned to avoid antagonizing people unnecessarily, after telling a girl to shut up and then watching her snarl every time she saw me (I&rsquo;m still afraid I&rsquo;ll see her again). I learned about the benevolent use of power after a school bully pushed me out into the rain and then a bigger kid pushed him (I owe that guy a drink).</p>

<p>And I learned that people and institutions often have overly high valuations of themselves - every school I&rsquo;ve attended has claimed to be one of the best in the state (I&rsquo;ve got two words for you - &ldquo;magnet school&rdquo;). California teachers receive tenure after just two years - next time a <a href="http://igs.berkeley.edu/library/htTeacherTenure.html">proposition</a> to fix that resurfaces (it didn&rsquo;t pass last time when Gov. Shwarzenegger pushed it), that&rsquo;s one I&rsquo;ll vote for.</p>
