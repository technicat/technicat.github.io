I finally got around to setting up a blog account on gamasutra, and as my first article reposted a postmortem that, ironically, I submitted to gamasutra ten years ago. Those guys work pretty fast - I submitted the article around 2AM and in the morning I found this nice plug in the News section, along with game art (I wonder where they got that).
