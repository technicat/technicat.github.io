<p>I saw tweets from<a href="http://flarb.com/"> flarb</a> about <a href="http://appfigures.com/">appfigures</a> yesterday so I checked it out. The unique feature it has over AppViz and AppAnnie is support for some Android appstores - well, two of them, Google Play and the Amazon appstore. Now, it disturbs me that I have different total numbers reported by each of the three tools I&rsquo;m now using, but setting that aside, it&rsquo;s nice to be able to compare sales on different appstores.</p>

<p>Here are my total downloads and upgrades for a three-month period:</p>

<p>and here I&rsquo;m graphing just my Android sales of <a href="http://hyperbowl3d.com/">HyperBowl</a> Lite and can compare Google Play vs. Amazon:</p>

<p>Too bad they don&rsquo;t have support for the Nook appstore - that would cover everything for me. But another unique feature they have is a REST API - that could replace the download stats I manually export and upload to my <a href="http://fugugames.com/">Fugu Games site</a>.</p>
