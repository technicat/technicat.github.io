<p>Migrating my <a href="http://technicat.com/">technicat</a> web site from <a href="http://forrest.apache.org/">Apache Forrest</a> to <a href="http://drupal.org/">drupal</a> entails a lot of cutting and pasting of HTML, but that&rsquo;s made even more laborious by the automatic line breaking in drupal. It&rsquo;s easy enough to turn that off by unchecking that filter in the default input formats, but since that&rsquo;s actually a useful feature when authoring new content, it&rsquo;s better to just add a new input format. Here, I created a Raw HTML input format with all the filters turned off.</p>
