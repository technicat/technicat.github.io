<p>Overall, I like developing for Android, but I don&rsquo;t like depending on AdMob for revenue (maybe I should try Mobclix, but I read some weird clause that seemed to say if you didn&rsquo;t make enough money, it would be turned back into ad money). It doesn&rsquo;t pay well, compared to iAds - just <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/fugubowl/id297032758">Fugu Bowl</a> on iOS brings in more than all my Android apps combined. And now that I&rsquo;ve started pushing out more iAd-supported iOS apps, I&rsquo;m earning ten times as much from iAds as AdMob.</p>

<p>Then there are the upgrades. The AdMob home page kept urging me to &ldquo;upgrade&rdquo; my login to use my Google login to access new features. Now, instead of logging in immediately, I have to click on extra button to bring up another login page. And since I have a separate Google account for all my ad stuff, I either have to log out of my other Google account or switch browsers (which is what I do - now I have Safari running just to view my AdMob account). And those new features they promised? Haven&rsquo;t seen them.</p>

<p>Not having learned my lesson, I succumbed to another &ldquo;upgrade&rdquo; recommendation this morning, for my house ads. Before, I thought the house ad feature was pretty cool - anytime one of my apps couldn&rsquo;t retrieve a paying ad, it would serve up one of my house ads so at least I could cross-promote. Now, for any of the house ads to appear, I have to specify a campaign duration, target impressions&hellip;forget about it.</p>

<p>I did make one upgrade that I don&rsquo;t regret. I switched all my AdMob apps over from the <a href="http://forum.unity3d.com/threads/77568-AdMob-plugin-that-works-in-Unity-3.2">free plugin</a> available on the Unity forum to the new one available from <a href="http://prime31.com/">Prime31</a>. The setup is way easier - no more editing and building Java code! And I think I&rsquo;ll have an easier time combining it with the <a href="http://forum.unity3d.com/threads/77546-OpenFeint-plugin-that-works-in-Unity-3.2">OpenFeint plugin</a> I&rsquo;m using for <a href="https://market.android.com/details?id=com.technicat.HyperBowlPro">HyperBowl</a>.</p>
