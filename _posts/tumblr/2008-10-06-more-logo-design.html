<p>Following on from the post of the <a href="http://www.fugugames.com/">Fugu Games</a> logo design, here&rsquo;s the design process of the <a href="http://www.technicat.com/">Technicat</a> logo, also from <a href="http://www.shanenakamuradesigns.com/">Shane Nakamura Designs</a>.</p>

<p>The first pass, to see if anything clicked:</p>

<p><a href="http://itshardtofondlepenguins.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/technicat-logo1-copy.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-929" title="technicat-logo1-copy" src="http://itshardtofondlepenguins.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/technicat-logo1-copy.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="357"/></a></p>

<p>But none did, so Shane made a an entirely different second pass.</p>

<p><a href="http://itshardtofondlepenguins.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/technicat-logo2-copy.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-931" title="technicat-logo2-copy" src="http://itshardtofondlepenguins.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/technicat-logo2-copy.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="647"/></a></p>

<p>This time around, I liked several, including the one near the lower left, but that one reminded me a bit too much of Harvard, and it had a similar form to the Fugu Games logo. The two in the second row from the top feature a nice non-rectangular shape, cool lettering, and neat asymmetric facial features (I&rsquo;m embarrassed that I didn&rsquo;t realize they were gamepad controls, but everyone else gets it). The curved enclosure on the left one reminds me of a cat looking out of a pet carrier, so the winner:</p>
