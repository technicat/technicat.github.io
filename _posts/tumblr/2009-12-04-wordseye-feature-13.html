<p><a href="http://itunes.com/app/wordseyefeature">WordsEye Feature 1.3</a> appeared on the App Store this week. It just has one fix - <a href="http://wordseye.com/">WordsEye</a> scenes are now scaled to fit the iPhone screen:</p>

<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2920" title="IMG_0047" src="http://itshardtofondlepenguins.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/IMG_0047.png" alt="IMG_0047" width="480" height="320"/></p>

<p>In the previous version, the images were not scaled, and since they&rsquo;re slightly larger than the iPhone screen a bit is cropped off the top and the right (like some of the haircuts I used to get)</p>

<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2921" title="IMG_0086" src="http://itshardtofondlepenguins.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/IMG_0086.png" alt="IMG_0086" width="480" height="320"/></p>

<p>Scaling-to-fit changes squashes the original image a bit, but I think it looks better overall. Of course, I could letterbox it (except the empty areas would go on the sides), but still, I think it looks better to fill up the screen.</p>

<p>Actually, that was the original behavior, but then (anyone not using <a href="http://unity3d.com/">Unity</a> stop reading here) I realized I had a massive memory leak accessing the convenient but deadly <a href="http://WWW.texture">WWW.texture</a>, so then I switched to <a href="http://WWW.DownloadImageToTexture">WWW.DownloadImageToTexture</a> which seemed to ignore the pixel insets that made <a href="http://WWW.texture">WWW.texture</a> fit the screen (and only on the iPhone - works fine on the <a href="http://www.apple.com/downloads/dashboard/justforfun/wordseyefeature.html">widget</a> version), but this time around, I belatedly realized that DownloadImageToTexture will automatically scale to the target texture, which makes sense - it&rsquo;s hard to download images if you have to know their original size. So now it just downloads into a screen-sized texture instead of into a texture matching the original image size with a bunch of insets that attempt to mash it into place. So we&rsquo;ve gone from broken-but-simple to broken-in-a-less drastic-way-but complicated to simple-again-and-hopefully-nothing-broken.</p>
