<p>Ah, sweet vindication. The latest Amazon review of my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Learn-Unity-iOS-Game-Development/dp/1430248750">Unity book</a> is not only a five-star review but specifically cites the Explore Further section I have at the end of each chapter.
</p><blockquote>Exploar further section in each chapter is consist of explaining Unity maunal, Reference manual, Scripting reference, and even On the web. This Exploar further is very good to me. Thanks.</blockquote>
This is especially satisfying because more than one editor pestered me to end each chapter with a Summary that just recapped the chapter with something like &ldquo;In this chapter, we learned about this, then we talked about that, then we implemented the other, yada yada&hellip;&rdquo; Which I really didn&rsquo;t want to do, because this isn&rsquo;t a research paper or a Dummies book, and personally, I just skip through that stuff when I read it (I usually don&rsquo;t forget everything I just read as soon as I reach the end of the chapter).

Ideally, I would have also had some entertaining industry or tech history stories like the ones in the Just Java books, but the only one I can think of is the long history of quaternions (and I forgot to put that one in). In any case, really the most important thing for developers to know at the end of the chapter is where to find more information (and get in the habit of reading the official documentation!)

But I had to put up with editors renaming the last section to Summary, adding new sections named Summary, and asking &ldquo;how about adding a Summary section?&rdquo; with some dubious claims that it&rsquo;s some sort of industry writing standard, and readers go there to see what&rsquo;s in the chapter (or, you could put that info at the beginning of the chapter, or maybe, just maybe, the reader will look in the table of contents). Never mind that the Summary section in the publisher guideline sample actually was more like my Explore Further section than a recap.

So, game developers who are complaining about game publishers, hey, it&rsquo;s tough all over. At least game publishers don&rsquo;t rewrite your code. In Microsoft Word. And communicate solely by leaving comments (OK, programmers do that, too, but hey, knock it off. It&rsquo;s annoying).
