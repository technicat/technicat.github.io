I’m looking forward to the eventual Unity integration of in-game video capture (“social gaming” for the buzzword-aware), but in the meantime, I tried out the plugin from [Kamcord](http://kamcord.com/) a while ago on my [Learn Unity](http://learnunity4.com/) book companion app, and it works great. Besides the video capture, it has a nice built-in GUI for video sharing, including YouTube, of course.
