<p>At work, I received several recommendations for the club sandwich served in the company cafeteria (the Chinese name for it actually is more like &ldquo;company&rdquo; sandwich). It&rsquo;s just like an American club sandwich, but instead of bacon and turkey, there&rsquo;s ham and tuna and scrambled egg. In other words, it&rsquo;s totally different. But it&rsquo;s good. Seriously, when I get back to the states, I might open up a franchise.</p>
