<p>Last week I issued my first revenue share check to an app developer partner. It was a really small check (I could have just bought him lunch instead) but I feel it was a milestone of sorts - now I feel like a publisher.</p>

<p>Of course, I&rsquo;ve been self-publishing apps (and one book) for a while, and I usually refer to myself as a developer, software developer, game developer, indie developer&hellip;but the term &ldquo;developer&rdquo; is so vague. It&rsquo;s like calling myself a worker. Except it&rsquo;s understood workers get paid for their work. Developers get invited to work on other people&rsquo;s projects for fun. &ldquo;Developer&rdquo; is not a useful title when it comes time to describe your business model, if that business model involves making money (or to sound less greedy, making a living).</p>

<p>So more and more when I&rsquo;ve been contacted about working on a project, I explain that either I get paid for the work or I get to publish the work. In other words, I&rsquo;m a contractor or a publisher. If you want me to work on your project, I&rsquo;m a contractor, I expect to get paid, and if you want me to work cheap or at some risk (like a fixed-price project), you have some convincing to do. Alternatively, if you&rsquo;re proposing a project that I can publish, where no one is paying the other, you have to convince me that we can get a project done in a timely and not-too-costly manner, everyone owns what they contributed, and we agree on an equitable revenue share, based on the contribution. And if you&rsquo;re just contributing an idea&hellip;let&rsquo;s go back to the contracting mode and you can pay me to fulfill your vision.</p>
