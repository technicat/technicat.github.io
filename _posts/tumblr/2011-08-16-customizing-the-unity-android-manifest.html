<p>This wasn&rsquo;t obvious to me from the documentation, but a search in the ever helpful Unity forum informed me that the Android manifest file created by Unity can be customized by placing your own version under Assets/Plugins/Android:</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m still just fumbling around with this stuff, and I don&rsquo;t know what really needs to be in the manifest, so my quick and dirty technique right now is to first perform a Build, copy the manifest file from the project Temp directory to Plugins, then edit that version. Works like a charm!</p>
