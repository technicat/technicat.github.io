<p>After the giddiness of the recent earthquakes subsided, I realized the <a href="http://earthquake.usgs.gov/eqcenter/recenteqsus/Maps/special/California_Nevada.php">earthquake map</a> I viewed is an excellent presentation in the mode of <a href="http://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/">Edward Tufte</a>,</p>

<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2051" title="picture-81" src="http://itshardtofondlepenguins.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/picture-81.png" alt="picture-81" width="535" height="482"/></p>

<p>Each square represents location, magnitude and the time span in which it occurred. That&rsquo;s efficient!</p>
