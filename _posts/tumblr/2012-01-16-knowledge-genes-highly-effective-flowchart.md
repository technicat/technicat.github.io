While googling for complimentary reviews of [my software essays](http://technicat.com/writing) that I could use to promote [my ebook](http://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/technicat-on-software-phil-chu/1108218697), I found this [interactive flowchart](http://www.knowledgegenes.com/home.aspx?kgid=11039&t=moretext) of my [Seven Habits of Highly Effective Programmers essay](http://technicat.com/writing/programming.html). Pretty cool!
