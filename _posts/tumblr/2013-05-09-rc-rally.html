<p>Besides Emo Ray, I worked on the RC Rally game on Playstation Home. I only did a little bit of HUD work just before it was released. HUD work, by the way, is a great way to get started on any project - you can make little changes to the code and see instant results and get a feel for how to work in that setup. Anyway, now I can say I worked on two PS3 projects and didn&rsquo;t miss out on this generation of consoles (sorry, XBox 360).</p>
