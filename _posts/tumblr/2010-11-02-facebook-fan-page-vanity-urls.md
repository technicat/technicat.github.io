I’m mostly satisfied with Facebook fan pages (I guess they’re not called “fan"&nbsp; pages anymore since that button got changed to "Like”), but the tortuous URLs bothered me - if you tell someone to visit your business or product fan page, you don’t want to just say “I can’t remember all the numbers at the end of the URL, just search for it in the Facebook search box”.

Now Facebook has vanity URL’s for fan pages, although I didn’t figure that out until just recently. I think I saw a mention on twitter, searched fruitlessly in the Facebook help section (Facebook is really good at some things, but privacy and documentation are not among them), and finally googled onto this [useful article](http://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/6109/How-to-Create-a-Facebook-Page-Vanity-URL.aspx). Google may be struggling to break into social networking, but they can console themselves that they provide the online help for everyone else.

So now I have the fan page URL’s [http://facebook.com/fugugames](http://facebook.com/fugugames) and [http://facebook.com/hyperbowl](http://facebook.com/hyperbowl)set up. (a minimum number of fans is required before an alias can be registered, so my Technicat page is out of luck) Remember them!
