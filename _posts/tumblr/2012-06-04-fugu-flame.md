One of the big new features in Unity 3.5 is the Shuriken particle system (that’s a pretty cool name - actually it would be a cool name for a game engine). You can see the difference between the old particle system component:

and the new one:

I’m not up to creating my own particle effects from scratch, but the Sample Particle Pack (or Simple Particle Pack?) on the Asset Store uses the new system and finally provides some decent-looking flame effects. I could use them for the torches in the Rome lane of [HyperBowl](http://hyperbowl3d.com/), and I’ve always wanted to create a little lighter app (not that the world needs another one, but it’s on my to-do list). So, while getting familiar with Shuriken, I created the [Fugu Flame](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.technicat.fuguflame) app (I thought about Fugu Lighter, but used alliteration as a tie-breaker). It could use some sound effects (at least a little lighter clicking sound while switching flames), tweak the flame startup period so you can see the flame grow from nothing, and I wonder if I can get the flame to sway, maybe if you shake the device.
