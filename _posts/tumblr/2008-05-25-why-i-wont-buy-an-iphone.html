<p>Three words: AT&amp;T (okay, four words). <!--more-->Setting aside price, the iPhone looks amazing, and I haven&rsquo;t been disappointed playing around with it at the Apple Store. But I&rsquo;d already heard mixed reviews of AT&amp;T mobile service from some friends, I remember I hated dealing with their operators long ago when they still had a monopoly (OK, that was a really long time ago), and I read an article that rated AT&amp;T and Sprint as the two lowest carriers in satisfaction (which accords with my experience - I tried Sprint twice and hated it, had OK experience with Nextel, Verizon and T-Mobile)</p>

<p>The clincher: after experiencing recent problems with T-Mobile Hotspot service using my Macbook Pro, I decided to try AT&amp;T&rsquo;s Laptop Connect, reasoning it might unchain me from Starbucks and Borders. The coverage map on the AT&amp;T web site indicated I was just barely outside the 3G area (within a block) and thus would fall back to the much slower Edge service (the one used for the iPhone, by the way), but a sales rep named Troy at the nearby AT&amp;T Store assured me their coverage included my neighborhood and that there was no risk on my part - I could return the modem for a refund and cancel the contract if I wasn&rsquo;t happy with the service. Although, after I repeated a couple of times, &ldquo;so I don&rsquo;t have to pay anything if I return it?&rdquo;, he suddenly remembered, &ldquo;you still have to pay the activation fee&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Despite that, I gave it a try, and turns out I could only get the Edge service - fast enough for email and very slow web browsing, but not fast enough to complete a MacOSX software update (the connection would invariably disconnect after hours of downloading). I figured, oh, the coverage map was right, but when I carried my laptop into the 3G coverage area, I had no connection at all.</p>

<p>I thought I had 30 days to return it, but after seeing that wasn&rsquo;t written anywhere in the paperwork I&rsquo;d received from Troy, I decided to play it safe and return it before a week had passed. Troy said, &ldquo;Oh, it didn&rsquo;t work?&rdquo;, and a different sales rep processed the cancellation and refund. A few weeks later, I received a bill for $111.36.</p>

<p>When I called the number on the bill to say that number should just include the activation fee, the phone rep informed me that since I had cancelled three days after the beginning of the month, I had to pay for the full month (&ldquo;we don&rsquo;t prorate&rdquo; sounded like a company motto), and if I wanted to remove the charge, I had to go back to the store to work it out with them. Which I did - went back, Troy wasn&rsquo;t there, but another rep went through the records, said Troy had written down a 3-day return period on his paperwork (but apparently not on mine - so is this something those guys just make up on the fly like car dealers?), but he ended up calling up a phone rep just like I did and waiting for fifteen minutes before this other phone rep agreed to remove the extra charges.</p>

<p>Even that took longer than it should have - the second phone rep told me to just send in a check for the activation fee, but since that wasn&rsquo;t separately itemized on the bill, I took a guess, which was off by slightly over two dollars, so a month later I got another bill. Now it&rsquo;s completely paid off, and I&rsquo;ll never by an iPhone. Well, maybe never. More likely an iTouch.</p>
