I started incorporating[iTween](http://itween.pixelplacement.com/) into [HyperBowl](http://hyperbowl3d.com/) yesterday (initially for camera animation, but I plan to replace all my scripted animation with it), and found there are a plethora of ease-in-ease-out options. A really nifty way to choose among them is to play with the[Robert Pennerâ€™s easing demo](http://robertpenner.com/easing/easing_demo.html):
