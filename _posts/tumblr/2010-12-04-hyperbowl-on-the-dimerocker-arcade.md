After a little prompting from the dimeRocker folks, I put [HyperBowl on the dimeRocker Arcade](http://apps.facebook.com/dimerocker/play/hyperbowl), their new game-portal-as-facebook-app. It took me only a few hours, downloading and importing the latest dimeRocker Unity package, installing the prefab, filling out the app details and uploading the build. I did that last night and found it approved (which is required for it to show up on the arcade front page as pictured below). I’m pleased to see it loads way faster then the one I host on [http://hyperbowl3d.com/](http://hyperbowl3d.com/)

Next, I’ll try integrating with the dimeRocker API. With their earlier platform (which will be discontinued in a few months), I got as far as retrieving the Facebook user name as the player name but didn’t quite get the leaderboard working. Hopefully, I’ll have more success this time and also get achievements working, as I intended to implement those anyway for the [iPhone version of HyperBowl](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/id344209253) with Game Center. Which reminds me, the optional App Store link on the dimeRocker Arcade page is a nice cross-promotional feature.

Eventually, I’ll think about using the monetization features. You don’t get ad-share revenue from the Arcade, but it does feature a virtual currency system you can use to get payments for game features, e.g. lock out certain levels, although I’m more inclined to offer extra bowling balls for sale.
