I finally mailed off my taxes yesterday. I probably spent less time than previous years on it but somehow it felt more aggravating. Possibly because I “crunched” on it. Normally, I buy some tax preparation software in December so I can get that last tax deduction for the year and then I gradually work on it over the next few months as all the 1099’s and such come and itemized deductions until I can’t stand it anymore and send it off. I alternate between TaxCut and Turbotax every year because they both really bug me. TaxCut has a mediocre user interface (especially with itemized lists) and Turbotax does something really annoying every year, like install a mystery licensing daemon or add a feature that turns out to be Windows-only.

This time, I bought Turbotax only to discover it couldn’t import my Taxcut return from the previous year - that is now a Windows-only feature (there is a PDF-import feature, which didn’t work), and even on Windows, it didn’t import everything, like my home office information. So I ended up buying Taxcut, also, which has all the user interface flaws of the previous versions (to add itemized entries to a field you have to go the Edit menu and Add an Itemized List, and then if you want to add to it later, you have to Open Itemized list and remember the list you were using for that particular field). It’s a pretty convenient business model when you can just release the same program every year without making any changes, except perhaps deciding what features to leave out of the Mac version.
