<p>Unity doesn&rsquo;t have a public bug database, but their email acknowledgments for bug reports do allow access to all of a user&rsquo;s reports. I&rsquo;ve always been a fan of open bug databases, starting with Sun&rsquo;s <a href="http://bugs.sun.com/">Bug Parade</a>, which as I recall allowed you to check if anyone else has already submitted the bug you found, aggregate information instead of duplicating it, and vote for the ones you need fixed first. So in the spirit of open bugs, here&rsquo;s the link to my latest Unity bug report, a <a href="http://intra.unity3d.com/fogbugz/default.asp?294067_vb8jj5c0">feature request for static batching on desktop Unity</a>.</p>
