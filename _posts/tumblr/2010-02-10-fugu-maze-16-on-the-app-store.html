<p><a href="http://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=295808255&amp;mt=8#">Fugu Maze 1.6</a> appeared on the App Store today, after a three-day approval process (that appears to be standard, now). Mainly, I released this update to test the latest version of the Unity iPhone engine, but also took this opportunity to throw in a couple more wall textures and add distance fog - I think that helps blend in the lighting cutoff when you have the flash light on and aiming down a corridor. Also, I cut down the accelerometer sampling frequency, which can improve the frame rate - the default is 60 samples/second, but to 10/s is enough to detect a device shake.</p>

<p>I see the iTunes links now go to a real web page, from which you can then go on to iTunes. Looks like it&rsquo;s still in progress (notice the &ldquo;By [?]&rdquo;) but it does list more of a my other apps than the iTunes page does. Also, the &ldquo;friendly&rdquo; version of the iTunes link - <a href="http://itunes.com/app/fugumaze">http://itunes.com/app/fugumaze</a> - still goes directly to iTunes, but maybe I just have to wait a while.</p>
