<p>There&rsquo;s an art to posting programming questions in an efficient, professional and informative manner. Over the years, from mail lists to Usenet to forums, I&rsquo;ve come to learn some classic effective techniques:
</p><ol><li>Make the title of the post really vague, e.g. &ldquo;I Need Help&rdquo; or &ldquo;A Coding Problem&rdquo;. Feel free to add a lot of exclamation marks and/or question marks. Anyone browsing the forum will be intrigued and unable to resist reading the post.</li>
	<li>Also describe the problem vaguely. Omit useful details like error messages, the functions you&rsquo;re using, the line of code in question, or what you&rsquo;re actually trying to accomplish. After all, if you knew all that, chances are you&rsquo;d have the answer, already.</li>
	<li>Or go the other extreme and overwhelm with detail. You can actually do both - post a huge blob of code and ask &ldquo;why doesn&rsquo;t this work?&rdquo;</li>
	<li>Write as if you&rsquo;re texting or twittering. Avoid whole words and complete sentences. Better yet, write in a single run-on sentence. Save all that careful spelling and punctuation for coding.</li>
	<li>Don&rsquo;t waste time reading your post before submitting it. Hit the Submit button as soon as you hit that last key. Ignore the Preview button - that&rsquo;s for people who worry about offending others.</li>
	<li>Don&rsquo;t read the manual. Reading the documentation for a function takes almost as much time as asking someone else to read it for you.</li>
	<li>If you do read the manual, and you found it incomplete or just hard to understand, don&rsquo;t tell anyone. Wait for someone to tell you to read the manual, and then you can submit another post saying you did read the manual.</li>
	<li>If no one answers, don&rsquo;t add any additional clarification or thought to the question. Just throw in some more question marks and and ask &ldquo;why isn&rsquo;t anyone helping me?&rdquo;</li>
	<li>If you don&rsquo;t like an answer, take offense. After all, someone is wasting your time with free advice.</li>
	<li>If you really don&rsquo;t like an answer, go on the offensive. The Internet is a great place to get the last word.</li>
</ol>
