So far, none of my iPhone apps have taken longer two weeks to get approved (well, except for that one that took a month to get rejected), but still it makes me appreciate the 24-hour turnaround I get on Mac widgets. I submitted an updated [HyperBowl Classic widget](http://www.apple.com/downloads/dashboard/games/hyperbowlclassic.html) last night and saw it on the Apple widget download site today.

This update includes the new and updated front end screens of the the current [HyperBowl web player](http://hyperbowl3d.com/).
