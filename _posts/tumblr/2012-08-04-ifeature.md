If this isn’t the first time you’ve looked at this blog, you’ll see I’m using a new theme, iFeature (the free version), from Cyberchimps (link at the bottom of this page). It’s pretty fancy schmancy - on the other end of the spectrum from the elegant and simple Twenty Eleven theme (check it out my sister’s site, [Alpha Girl Comics](http://alphagirlcomics.com/)). Both themes are easily accessible from the WordPress Theme section of the dashboard on on Wordpress.org.

One big improvement over my previous theme is this one contains some of my sprawling images that were running over the side. It also adds a product section, a footer for widgets, social icons and built-in share/like buttons. The most time-consuming part here is finding images for the “slider” section above the posts - for it to look good, they have to be about the same size.
