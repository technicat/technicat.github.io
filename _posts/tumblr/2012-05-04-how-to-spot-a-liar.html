<p>This is one of the more immediately applicable TED talks I&rsquo;ve seen:</p>

<p>However, it doesn&rsquo;t help with the Internet. Is it a friend or Zynga who&rsquo;s asking me to play Farmville (seriously, I have a friend who&rsquo;s so enthused about the game I thought it had to be a computer-generated message). Are leading advertisers really interested in my app? Are you really following my tweets? Is there really a pile of money sitting in a bank somewhere just waiting for my assistance in retrieving it? (OK, that last one is pretty easy). It kind of crept up on us, but the Internet is a big fat liar (but in that sense, it seems to have passed some kind of Turing test).</p>

<p>Spam filters are working well, these days. I think the next step is a veracity filter. Instead of hitting a spam/junk-mail button, hit a button labelled &ldquo;Lie!&rdquo; Or maybe Google can step with Google Polygraph (Google Truth? Google Fibsense?)</p>
