Alas, the Twin Palms is gone…

_Originally written on Epinions in June 2003:_

My parents were in Pasadena and I wanted to treat them to a fine dinner for their anniversary. Twin Palms fit the bill perfectly - located in walkable Old Pasadena, this restaurant features a fine mid-to-high priced menu in an accessible and casual setting. (so I didn’t have to get too dressed up)

The atmosphere exudes California - the restaurant’s name refers to the palm trees that appear to support the tent covering the outdoor section of the restaurant. That area is the larger seating area, containing long tables in a picnic arrangement, live band, and the rotisserie on display. The indoor area has a more conservative look with high-backed cloth-covered seats along the side and round tables in the center, but even there, it gets noisy once the 8-9pm dinner crowd arrives and the conversation level picks up.

The entrees are split into the following categories: pizza, light, seafood, and rotisserie/steaks. From the latter, I had the Moroccan spiced leg of lamb in wine sauce on top of an eggplant and white bean puree, which was tender and flavorful, slightly fatty, but excellent. My parents elected the seafood, and I had a taste of each - the Sea Bass Vera Cruz, served on potatoes in cilantro salsa was tasty, but not as delicious as the orange roughy special, which felt like it nearly melted in my mouth.

A suggested wine is listed with each entree - handy for the wine-ignorant like me, but I just selected a sparkling apple cider with dinner and coffee with dessert.

The dessert menu offers approximately ten selections. I chose the Watsonville Apple Pie, which is served with a tasty streusel topping and ala mode. My parents had the Classic Creme Brulee and South Coast Lemon Meringue Tarte.

The waiters were attentive but unobtrusive throughout the dinner. The final tab for the three of us, including tip, was $120.
