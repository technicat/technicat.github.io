<p>I decided to check out the competition for my <a href="http://hyperbowl3d.com/">HyperBowl</a> games on the App Store - a search for &ldquo;bowling&rdquo; returns over 100 apps! But with over 100,000 apps on the store total, I guess I was expecting worse. I tried out a few - here&rsquo;s a sampler:</p>

<p>300 Bowl. It&rsquo;s in German.</p>

<p>Flick Bowling has been on the App Store a long time and is a typically polished FreeVerse product.</p>

<p>Galactic Bowl is very slick with some fancy character animation (possibly accounting for some long level-load times). It&rsquo;s priced accordingly as one of the more expensive bowling apps.</p>

<p>Downhill Bowling is Unity-based bowling game (the only other one I know of besides mine is Zombie Bowling)</p>

<p>Malibu Bowl offers a coconut as a bowling ball.</p>

<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2909" title="IMG_0301" src="http://itshardtofondlepenguins.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/IMG_0301.png" alt="IMG_0301" width="320" height="480"/></p>

<p>Action Bowling.</p>

<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2910" title="IMG_0304" src="http://itshardtofondlepenguins.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/IMG_0304.png" alt="IMG_0304" width="320" height="480"/></p>

<p>And then there are my two HyperBowl lanes, <a href="http://itunes.com/app/hyperbowlclassic">HyperBowl Classic</a> and <a href="http://itunes.com/app/hyperbowlrome">HyperBowl Rome</a>. And the free <a href="http://itunes.com/app/fugubowl">FuguBowl</a>.</p>
