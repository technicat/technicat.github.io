<p>With the impending iTunesConnect holiday shutdown, I thought I&rsquo;d finally get around to uploading app video previews. In the process, I only just discovered the iOS 8-&gt;Yosemite video capture. That&rsquo;s pretty cool - with your device connected, just bring up Quicktime Player and create a movie with the device selected as the video (and assuming you want the audio, microphone) source.</p>

<p>What Apple&rsquo;s iTunesConnect instructions don&rsquo;t tell you is that if you just try to upload one of those videos, you&rsquo;ll get an error message that the frame rate is too high (it would be nice if they actually stated the desired frame rate, but Apple is like that person you talk to who goes out of his way to avoid big words because he thinks you&rsquo;re stupid). The most convenient way I&rsquo;ve found to get around this is just import the video into iMovie, Create App Preview, drag the clip into the timeline, then Share to App Preview. If I actually knew how to use iMovie I could do something fancier, but at least I figured out how to throw together some clip segments, like this one for <a href="http://hyperbowl3d.com/">HyperBowl</a>:</p>
