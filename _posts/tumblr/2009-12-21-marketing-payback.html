<p>If my attempts at marketing seem lackadaisical, one of my reasons, or excuses, is the do-unto-others rule - I don&rsquo;t want to inflict sales tactics that annoy the heck out of me. But then it occurred to me that all those aggressive marketers who&rsquo;ve pestered me have it coming. So instead of sending out Christmas cards as I should (but usually don&rsquo;t), I&rsquo;m planning to send end-of-year marketing missives to the LA Times and Orange County Register for all those teens they send banging on my door selling newspaper subscriptions, to Millennium Sales for that last batch of college students they sent door-to-door selling magazine subscriptions, Time Warner for the grown men they sent banging on my door selling cable/phone/internet subscriptions (and their telemarketer who called me asking why I don&rsquo;t have their phone service - answer: too many telemarketing calls). Now, let&rsquo;s see who else has been naughty or nice&hellip;
</p><blockquote>Hello,

Since I&rsquo;ve received sales promotions from Time Warner Cable in the form of numerous door-to-door salesmen and telemarketing calls, I&rsquo;m sure you won&rsquo;t mind if I return the favor and tell you about the great products I&rsquo;m selling - namely, the HyperBowl series of games for the iPhone and iPod touch, available on the App Store via the following links:

<a href="http://itunes.com/app/hyperbowl">http://itunes.com/app/hyperbowl</a>
<a href="http://itunes.com/app/hyperbowlclassic">http://itunes.com/app/hyperbowlclassic</a>
<a href="http://itunes.com/app/hyperbowlrome">http://itunes.com/app/hyperbowlrome</a>
<a href="http://itunes.com/app/hyperbowlforest">http://itunes.com/app/hyperbowlforest</a>

If you purchase one or more of these titles before January 1, thirty percent of my proceeds will go to the charity Get Well Gamers, an organization that provides video games for hospitalized children to assist in pain management. General information about the game is available at <a href="http://hyperbowl3d.com/">http://hyperbowl3d.com/</a>

Thanks for your attention, and have a happy holiday!</blockquote>
