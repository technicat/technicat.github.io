<p>While cleaning out some old files, I found this NDA I received from some Caltech grads starting up a mobile game company. The NDA was pretty standard except for this last clause stating that I agreed to any future version of the NDA, whether or not I agreed to it. When I tried to explain no sane person would sign this, the guy gave some standard &ldquo;our lawyer drafted this to protect our company&rsquo;s interests&rdquo; and then hung up on me. This is why I don&rsquo;t look for projects on <a href="http://craigslist.org/">Craig&rsquo;s List</a>, anymore.</p>
