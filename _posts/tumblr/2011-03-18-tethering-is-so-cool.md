Silly me, ever since I terminated my Time-Warner cable broadband, I’ve been searching the city for wifi hotspots without realizing that my phone has wifi tethering, i.e. can act as a wifi hotspot using its 3G connection, which is a standard feature in Android 2.2 (they beat Apple to the punch on this one). Once again, I’m glad my Samsung Galaxy running Android 2.1 went kaput and was replaced under warranty - I know of no other way to upgrade the firmware.

The first thing I did was run [Speedtest](http://speedtest.net/) with it.

Speedtest gives it a D+ but that’s in comparison to all broadband connections. Certainly, at 1Mb/s downloading, it’s a fifth of the performance I had with cable broadband, but the latter was costing me $50/month while my Android data plan with T-mobile is $20. And I think the 1MB/s upload speed through my phone actually beats the upload speed I had with cable. Regular web browsing, Facebooking, etc. feels fine. Downloading iOS apps takes a while, upgrading my iPad to iOS 4.3 took over an hour. Downloading the latest XCode looks like its going to be an ordeal. But that’s no worse (or perhaps even better) than the AT&T connection I’ve been getting at Starbucks. And I don’t have to buy all those lattes.
