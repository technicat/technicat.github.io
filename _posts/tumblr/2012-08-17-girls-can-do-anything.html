<p>I haven&rsquo;t paid much attention to the whole &ldquo;girlfriend mode&rdquo; kerfuffle. I don&rsquo;t want to pile on to the guy - for all I know it&rsquo;s just his way of letting the world know he has a girlfriend (now, if he was gay and the game featured a &ldquo;boyfriend mode&rdquo;, this would be a sign of progress).</p>

<p>But it does fit into a faux bro geek machismo, which by itself isn&rsquo;t so bad, except when it leads to &ldquo;girls can&rsquo;t&hellip;&rdquo; patter, which there still is amazingly a lot of. One can dismiss Joe Potbelly who can&rsquo;t balance a checkbook yet is opining that girls can&rsquo;t do math or play sports (although not so easy to dismiss if he starts spewing invective and threats through the anonymity of the Internet), but it&rsquo;s painful when you hear women talking that way, too, and just plain harmful when people in authoritative and career-influencing positions utter such pronouncements - forget sports, even in cooking, music, comedy&hellip;you&rsquo;d think women were just walking wombs (and don&rsquo;t get me started on the Taliban).</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s no need to get into left-brain/right-brain or other inane arguments. Just look around. And not just the US women&rsquo;s team at the Olympics (that was awesome). Like when I was walking near the wetlands across the street and saw a snake. I warned a woman who was walking her dog, and as the three of us recoiled in fear and speculated on whether the snake was poisonous, a little girl happened by, identified the species of the snake and pronounced it harmless, picked it up by the tail and tossed it into the bushes, then proceeded on her merry way. See, girls can do anything. Just ask the snake.</p>
