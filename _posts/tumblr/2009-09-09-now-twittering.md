I finally gave in and set up a[Twitter account](http://twitter.com/fugugames), a bit later than I should have, as I failed to stake out my preferred username (technicat). I really just wanted to get familiar with it so I could play around with creating a Twitter client, but I have to admit, it is kind of addictive. Just like my Facebook wall, though, I see I have to figure out some sort of balance. My account started out with a default set of followed twitterers helpfully supplied by Twitter, including Kevin Smith, Denise Richards, and Neil Gaiman. But the Kevin Smith feed is so busy it crowded out everything else, and Denise Richards, well, gotta admit I liked her in Starship Troopers and that movie with Neve Campbell, but I don’t want everyone thinking I’m hanging on her every word (and really, I only watched a few episodes of her reality series). Neil Gaiman, on the other hand, is just right, in terms of twitter frequency and geek cred.

And the geek cred is part of my rationale in using my account as an “official” game dev blog (game dev microblog?) channel for promoting my work (I have a twitter HTML widget pasted into my Fugu Games site). So now I can spare all my high school classmates on Facebook my daily programming tribulations, and just subject them to what I had for lunch today (which I’ll keep off my twitter feed, if I have enough discipline. See, everyone’s a winner!). And then there’s this blog, which is still a hodgepodge. But I’ll keep writing here, if only to express myself in complete sentences.
