A few weeks ago, I got tired of seeing my Amazon reviewer ranking somewhere below eleven million (which was pretty high if you consider I wrote maybe two reviews), so I copied all my goodreads reviews over (or I guess I could have just waited, as Amazon bought goodreads…)

Anyway, my reviewer ranking is up close to 200,000, and six out of nine people have rated my reviews helpful, which means three of them didn’t like them, which typically includes authors, like the one responding below. Now, as an app and and book author, I also downvote reviews I don’t like, when I can (although if it’s a well thought-out critique, I try to restrain myself). But my rule is don’t engage. Don’t engage!

So I felt obligated to click the “No” button on “Does this comment add to the conversation?” But I did feel ambivalent about it. I mean, admittedly it was a flimsy review (I would expand on it, but I really don’t remember anything about the book except that it was surprisingly dull). And maybe he intended it to be this funny. But I don’t remember his book being that entertaining. On the upside, he apparently read my other 87 reviews, including the one on Alexander Hamilton (why couldn’t he mention Buffy? Was that what he meant by “pop-crap”?)
