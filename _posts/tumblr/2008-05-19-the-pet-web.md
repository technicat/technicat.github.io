As you can probably tell from my posted cat photos, I have a cat. My vet recently sent me/her an [e-card](http://www.sloppykisscards.com/partners/vetinsite/709/mqxhb6rgd8) from [Sloppy Kiss Cards](http://www.sloppykisscards.com/). <!--more-->It’s interesting, a little creepy, and they seem to have the same music for every card.

Coincidentally, I also just heard about [Petentials](http://www.petentials.com/), “the Internet for pets”, where pets can blog and find dates!

Now, I like my cat. She’s good company, I can trade cute-pet stories with colleagues to counter all the cute-kid stories from married coworkers, and, frankly, this cat is a chick magnet (way to earn your keep!) But the pet web thing is pretty weird, the owner acting as a proxy for the pet (or is the pet providing an alternative identity for the owner?). On the other hand, maybe it’s the next part of the Web 2.0 boom. How about a [Second Life](http://www.secondlife.com/) virtual world for pets? Now that would be cool - all those furry four-legged avatars!
