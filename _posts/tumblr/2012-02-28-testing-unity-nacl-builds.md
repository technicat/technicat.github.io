It took me a while to figure this out, but here’s how to test your Unity NaCl build right after the build. In Chrome, go to Preferences, select Extensions, check Developer Mode. This will make available the “Load unpacked extension…” button. Use that to select the build folder, and then it’s installed just like any extension from the Chrome webstore.
