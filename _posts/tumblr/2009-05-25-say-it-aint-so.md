I learned from [Daniel Weinreb’s blog](http://danweinreb.org/blog/why-did-mit-switch-from-scheme-to-python) that [6.001 Structures and Interpretations of Computer Programming](http://ocw.mit.edu/OcwWeb/Electrical-Engineering-and-Computer-Science/6-001Spring-2005/CourseHome/) is retired from the MIT computer science curriculum. There are many MIT courses that I didn’t understand (and barely passed) and realized later were really useful. This is a course that I didn’t understand but learned to appreciate after the fact. Of course I didn’t have much cause to use Scheme in my career (although a surprising amount of Lisp), but as software professionals try to treat their practice more and more as manufacturing (which strikes me as squeezing a cube into a circular receptacle), 6.001 and it’s accompanying [text](http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/book/book.html) was one of the few works that pushes for intellectual and esthetic appreciation of programming and was still cool to cite among bloggers (a few mentions by [Joel On Software](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/)). Oh well, back to design patterns and agile development.
