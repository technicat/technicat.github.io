This talk by Ed Catmull is pretty long for a YouTube video but I found every minute of it interesting - and I’m saying this as a person who routinely blanks out in meetings until someone looks at me and asks “what do you think?”

The only thing I might quibble with is that, while he mentions the mistakes of other companies like SGI and explains the culture and process at Pixar that attempts to avoid mistakes like that, it is unrealistic to expect other companies to change their personalities drastically. Just like people, companies can learn and get better at what they do, branch or move into related areas, but they each have their core competencies and basic attitudes.

I was employed at a few defense companies during the industry downturn of the early 90’s - many had fantasies of turning into commercial companies, but these were people and organizations that had never started a project without being paid in advance (nice work, if you can get it). Even the internal staff wouldn’t service an office workstation unless it was listed on a paid government contract. Development of new products in anticipation of revenue? Forget it. I “maintained” one software product by waiting for someone to order a copy, then we borrowed a workstation from another group, compiled it and shipped it. I hope it worked. Meanwhile, aggressive defense companies like SAIC that focused on their core business ate our lunch.

Mr. Catmull cited a couple of major mistakes made by SGI - acquiring Cray and not following through on a PC board. Maybe he’s right - if they’d put a serious effort into a PC board (I never even heard of it), perhaps they’d at least have dominated over other high-end PC-based graphics workstations like those from Intergraph. But anyone who thinks SGI could have been nVidia, forget it. SGI was toast long ago. This was a company that charged you a support contract for the privilege of sending in bug reports - not even sending them in, phoning them in. My company paid for a developer support contract and that group refused to accept bug reports - those had to go through the phone support line. SGI invented OpenGL but responded to our bug reports in the standard API by sending us a marketing team who tried to persuade us to rely on their proprietary API’s, which by the way varied among the three different OS’s running on their three different main platforms. This was a company that still had great engineers, but making $200 graphics boards was never going to happen (think how much they charged just for memory boards on the Indy) - their personality was geared entirely toward making money off high-priced graphics systems and they lasted for a while selling huge pieces of hardware to the likes of Disney. Maybe that’s why they bought Cray.

Mr. Catmull talks about how they threw out a straight-to-video Toy Story sequel project and started it from scratch as a real movie. This may be stretching the analogy a bit, but I’d venture to predict that if Pixar tried to get into the budget CG video business, it’d be a mess. It’s just not them.
