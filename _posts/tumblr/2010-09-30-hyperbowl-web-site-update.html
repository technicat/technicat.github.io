<p>While I was updating the <a href="http://hyperbowl3d.com/">HyperBowl web site</a> to use Unity 3.0 (released this Monday), I decided to clean up the site a bit, removing links to many of the other versions of HyperBowl (if you&rsquo;re playing this one, there&rsquo;s really not much reason to switch to another web version or the widget, unless you want to play offline), and focus on promoting the iPhone/iPad version (that&rsquo;s the one I&rsquo;m trying to make money on, anyway). I tweaked the text color, too, which I think is an improvement:</p>

<p><a href="http://itshardtofondlepenguins.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/Screen-shot-2010-09-30-at-1.06.04-PM.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3840" title="Screen shot 2010-09-30 at 1.06.04 PM" src="http://itshardtofondlepenguins.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/Screen-shot-2010-09-30-at-1.06.04-PM.png" alt="" width="665" height="382"/></a></p>

<p>Also, as before, I used a different style sheet for presentation on the iPhone and iPod touch, striving to get all the important stuff on one (small) screen, and leaving out the portion used for displaying the web player, since that doesn&rsquo;t run on the iPhone. Unfortunately, I don&rsquo;t know how to remove the &ldquo;Install Unity&rdquo; badge, so I just relocated it off screen (you&rsquo;ll see it if you scroll down). I did have some convoluted Javascript to remove the badge in the Unity 2.x version, but I&rsquo;m not sure I can reproduce it with the new setup.</p>

<p>I probably want to do the same thing for the iPad (again, a lot of space used for framing a non-functioning web player), but with its bigger screen, it&rsquo;s not as much an issue.</p>
