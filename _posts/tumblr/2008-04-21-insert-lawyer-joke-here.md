When I registered [Fugu Games](http://www.fugugames.com/) as a trademark last year, I got this nice and threatening letter claiming that it could be confused with the FUBU hip-hop clothing line.

But I checked with a couple of attorney friends (OK, sometimes theyâ€™re the good guys), and they opined that these guys were just going through the motions of intimidation so they could charge their client. A year later, that seems to be the case. Notice how they managed to misspell the trademark name on the second page!
