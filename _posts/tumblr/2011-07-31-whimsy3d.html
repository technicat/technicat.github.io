<p>After trying out <a href="http://comiccms.com/">ComicCMS</a> with just my WordsEye images on <a href="http://itshardtofondlepenguins.com/">http://itshardtofondlepenguins.com/</a> I decided to try it with Unity. I just followed the ComicCMS manual instructions on adding support for swf files, but adding &ldquo;unity3d&rdquo; to the file types instead, and adding object/embed code for Unity instead of Flash. I didn&rsquo;t have any luck with the Unity 3.x javascript embedding, so I just copied and tweaked the Unity 2.x code I still have on my Fugu Games site. It doesn&rsquo;t seem to work with IE for some reason, but who cares, it&rsquo;s IE. The result is on <a href="http://whimsy3d.com/">http://whimsy3d.com/</a></p>
