<p>Like everyone else in a fifty mile radius of LA, I have a half-finished screenplay stashed away. But at a recent wedding, I caught up with some friends who actually finished a whole movie, <a href="http://www.buygamers.com/">Gamers</a>, a couple of years ago, with <a href="http://buygamers.com/interviews.htm">real actors</a> like John Heard, Beverly D'Angelo and Kelly LeBrock (remember the John Hughes movie Weird Science?)</p>

<p>Apparently the movie is out on DVD now, and with a recent <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rmgk09MLS-k">YouTube video</a>. Nice thing about living around here - you get to meet some pretty creative and motivated people.</p>
