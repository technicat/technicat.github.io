<p>One thing I don&rsquo;t miss about working in a corporate office is the pointless arguments. Employers may fuss about employee web surfing, but at least that&rsquo;s educational (face it, it saves you the expense of a company library and research division) and everyone can get their Christmas shopping done while they&rsquo;re stuck in their cubicles during crunch time. But I do regret all the time I wasted trapped while someone&rsquo;s trying to prove a &ldquo;point&rdquo;. Instead of the traditional programmer quiz, I think interviewers should prompt applicants to start arguing and see if they fall into one of the following categories, based on motivation.
</p><ul><li>Likes arguing. This person enjoys arguing as recreation, and is actually disappointed if you try to end the argument with an agree-to-disagree or even if you cut it short by conceding the argument. This may be fun in a social setting (not for me), but is a real pain if you&rsquo;re trying to get something done.</li>
	<li>Likes to win (aka last-word-itis). It doesn&rsquo;t even matter what the original point of contention is, he&rsquo;s got to have the final say and carry home the debater&rsquo;s trophy. I&rsquo;ve even had a couple of coworkers follow me around the office when I tried to just walk away so they could get that last word in (When Arguing Turn to Stalking - sounds like a Lifetime movie)</li>
	<li>Never-wrong. This can look like last-word-itis, but the motivation is different. This person just needs to make sure everyone knows he&rsquo;s right and incapable of making a mistake. If presented with indisputable evidence or incontrovertible logic that he&rsquo;s wrong, he&rsquo;ll change the subject in mid-stride and argue another point. This is a dangerous guy to work with, since, logically, if he&rsquo;s never wrong, than someone else must be. Try pointing out a bug in his code.</li>
	<li>Narcissism. You&rsquo;ll find this in many company leaders, famous and not famous. It has elements of the previous two categories, but the underlying motivation is that everyone has to see the world from his point of view, which revolves around him. It includes last-word-itis, but the game is rigged, so instead of working for the last word, an argument typically concludes with a &ldquo;let&rsquo;s stop talking about it&rdquo;, and then a parting shot. And it has a strong never-wrong element, but logic is a quicker casualty - with no victory in sight, the argument ends with &ldquo;if you just knew what I have to deal with&rdquo;. On the plus side, it&rsquo;s a lot easier to end it than with the recreational arguer - if you want to just get out of there, nod in sympathy about now no one understands him, cluck sympathetically about all the surfers trespassing at his beachside mansion, and give a how-dare-they at the employees who forced him to mistreat them.</li>
</ul>
Of course, there are plenty of arguments you can join in on from the home office. Just look at the forum threads that just won&rsquo;t die. Just remember, your argument style will be archived on the Internet for posterity. Don&rsquo;t engage - walk away.
