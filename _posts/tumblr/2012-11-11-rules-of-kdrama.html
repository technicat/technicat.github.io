<p>I&rsquo;m using Hulu Plus as my current substitute for regular TV. It&rsquo;s got a lot of content but lacks most of my must-see shows - currently I&rsquo;m missing out on Walking Dead, for example. To fill in the gap, I&rsquo;ve been checking out their bevy of Korean drama - it even has its own category in the Genre page and a &ldquo;beginner&rsquo;s guide&rdquo; of selections.</p>

<p>I gather I&rsquo;m late to the &ldquo;Korean wave&rdquo; of entertainment (even Obama has extolled its virtues) but I&rsquo;ve been playing catchup with Korean dramas on Hulu Plus, my current substitute for regular TV, since they don&rsquo;t have much in the way my usual must-watch shows (I&rsquo;m missing out on Walking Dead right now), but they have an abundance of kdrama, even given its own category and a &ldquo;beginner&rdquo; selection. I peruse <a href="http://dramabeans.com/">dramabeans.com</a> for recommendations, though.</p>

<p>I won&rsquo;t make any assumptions about Korean culture based on the shows (might be like piecing together a picture of the US based on The Vampire Diaries and Gossip Girl), but here&rsquo;s the universe of kdramas:</p>

<p>Stories run for one season, twenty episodes or so, like a really long miniseries.</p>

<p>Episodes last more than an hour, so they pack a lot of story in each one.</p>

<p>The beginning typically starts out wacky, even if it gets really serious later, and often includes an out of the blue action sequence, like a motorbike race or fight sequence. I usually can&rsquo;t tell if I&rsquo;m going to like the series until I see the second or third episode.</p>

<p>The last episode of the season is often a mixed bag since they have to wrap everything up, sometimes too neatly, sometimes not neat enough.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of head slapping. They should wear helmets. Actually, some of the guys have hairdos that look like helmets.</p>

<p>Lurking is easy. Stand behind a pole or corner, stick your head out to eavesdrop on some people twenty feet away and somehow you&rsquo;re invisible.</p>

<p>Romantic gestures include piggyback rides (tall women need not apply), dragging by the wrist (I keep thinking a dislocated shoulder will result) and back hugs.</p>

<p>Despite all that dragging around, most of the stories are led by women or split 50-50 in importance between the male and female leads. The female lead is typically spunky, sometimes a tomboy, has a healthy appetite, likes to kick men in the shins, is a good cook, inexperienced in romance, wants to have a career and doesn&rsquo;t want to get married early.</p>

<p>The leads are ridiculously cute. It&rsquo;s like watching puppies mate.</p>

<p>Every story has &ldquo;second leads&rdquo;. Thus the love triangle. Or love triangle list, as the potential pairings grow.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of drinking, drinking competitions, drunken karaoke. Both men and women.</p>

<p>There are no medical privacy rules. Doctors will cheerfully supply any and all information to the villain.</p>

<p>Many actresses started out with a singing career. Very handy for all the singing scenes (it&rsquo;s not bad, I enjoy the drunken karaoke numbers).</p>

<p>Some plots are wickedly complicated. Like he knows that she knows he&rsquo;s lying, but she doesn&rsquo;t know that he knows that she knows that he&rsquo;s lying. That&rsquo;s where I start yelling at the screen, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s going on?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t watch hungry. There&rsquo;s always footage of good food, especially barbeque.</p>

<p>Lots of crying. And not just by the women. I hope they have a lot of water bottles on set - dehydration must be an issue.</p>

<p>They excel in the romance department. It&rsquo;s like they have design patterns. For example, woman upset or drunk staggers into traffic, guy pulls her out of harms way and into a safe hug.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know if I&rsquo;d enjoy them more or less if I understood Korean. Possibly less - I&rsquo;ve read complaints about an actor&rsquo;s pronunciation (which might distract me like English actors who struggle to speak American). Instead, I&rsquo;m enjoying the range of inflection, from cutesy girl talk to something that sounds like a cat coughing up a hairball. I especially like exclamations like &ldquo;Aiissh!&rdquo; and &ldquo;Aigoo!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Any non-Korean language is spoken excruciatingly slowly, whether it&rsquo;s Chinese or English. I think they must recruit English-speaking actors from tourists (to say it&rsquo;s wooden would be an insult to Pinocchio). The most natural sounding English is from actors who are probably Korean-American or at least spent their youth here.</p>
