It’s been three years since my approval as a Comic Con Professional, so now I’m required to send in new verification materials, namely credited work in the past three years (this is a new take on publish or perish!) If you’ve been working solely on a long or cancelled project, or didn’t get credit, you’re screwed.

I’ve released a few self-published apps in the past few years, so I should be covered, but I also have this cool credit inside Playstation Home for the Emo-Ray bear battle game from Heavy Water. Too bad Home will be disappearing early next year (can’t run it on PS4, anyway, so good thing I took this pic, however I took it).
