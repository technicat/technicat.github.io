<p>Yesterday, I received one of my more interesting pieces of spam, an invitation from <a href="http://www.capwip.org/">The Center for Asia-Pacific Women in Politics</a> to attend <a href="http://www.capwip.org/3rdglobalcongress.htm">The Third Global Congress of Women in Politics and Governance</a>.<!--more--></p>

<p>It&rsquo;s for &ldquo;Parliamentarians, Decision-makers in National Governments; Environment Organizations / Agencies; Youth Leaders and Media Practitioners; Funding / Donor Agencies / Organizations&rdquo;. I&rsquo;m not sure where I fit in - maybe I&rsquo;m a Media Practitioner.</p>

<p>This was sent to me via webmaster@technicat.com, an address that I&rsquo;ve never used for official business, either taken off an old version of my web site or just conjured up as a likely address. It&rsquo;s a nice break from porno spam, pyramid scam spam, refi spam, and help-me-launder-money spam, but I do get plenty of junk mail from non-profits. I&rsquo;m a member of the <a href="http://www.aclu.org/">ACLU</a> (a card-carrying member, but not a generous-donor member), but I&rsquo;m not a fan of their opt-out mail list sharing policy. Hardly a progressive attitude on privacy.</p>

<p>One benefit of non-profits passing your name around like panhandlers sharing a mark is that from a few donations in years past, I now have a stockpile of complimentary address labels from a dozen agencies. Too bad many of them feature my name misspelled (Phillip instead of Philip). That&rsquo;s my new criterion for writing a check - you get nothing if you can&rsquo;t get my name right.</p>
