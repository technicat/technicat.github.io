After reading on the web that Kanye West only communicates via email, no skype or phone, I’ll say something that I don’t say often - I’m with Kanye on this one. I only have skype (which I think of as “skypus interruptus”) on when I’m working for someone who insists on it, and then I’m rewarded with a stream of is-it-done-yet’s, which makes it remarkably difficult to actually get anything done, not to mention jokes, salutations, and random questions from coworkers. There should be a rule - if you have something worth interrupting someone’s work, you should have to walk over and talk face-to-face. And this just might help combat America’s obesity epidemic.

But realtime chat is still better than phone meetings. In general, I feel like people who only want to discuss business over the phone are determined to waste my time, in particular, third-party recruiters (not first-party recruiters - if they want to talk, there’s actually something to talk about, like, a job), and people in the ad business. Recent emails I’ve received from ad people are filled with phrases like “Let’s talk!”, “Action Required”, and “Meeting Request”, instead of giving me useful information.

I always thought pr/marketing/ad people had a screwy way of doing things, almost as if they’re taught, take everything you’re supposed to do for a smoothly running engineering project, and do the opposite (or perhaps just watch The Apprentice and do what they do). I’ve sat in cubicles listening to nearby PR or account managers spend easily an hour at a time just shooting the breeze with their counterpart at the other end until finally getting to the reason for the call.

This is amusing (unless you’re sitting nearby trying to think), until it turns into unnecessary crunch time work for you. At my first stint in a commercial software company, I saw our marketing department tell our artists they needed ad material in a few hours, after casually discussing it with the targeted magazine for months. I’ve been on the receiving end, too, pestered by our marketing director to crank out a demo build in a few hours, only to find out secondhand months later that it was never used.

Which reminds me, although engineers get knocked on their people skills, people in the people business don’t seem any better. I’ve had some ad agencies inquire about my services in the past year. None of them made any mention of payment or inquired about my rate, one of them gave me a nice reply when I said I wasn’t available at that time, another didn’t bother to reply at all when I mentioned my rate, and another wanted me to sign an NDA and then look over their code before discussing even the nature of the business arrangement. I love watching Mad Men, and Don Draper is a cool cat, but I wouldn’t want to work for him.
