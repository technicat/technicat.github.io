<p>The sales ranking for <a href="http://search.barnesandnoble.com/HyperBowl/Technicat-LLC/e/2940043856555">HyperBowl on the NOOK Color</a> has improved. At one point it was over 11,000 and now it&rsquo;s approaching 8,000. I have no idea what that number actually means, but I hope that number is among everything on the NOOK Store and not just apps (when I hit the Shopping button on my NOOK and searched for all apps, I got only 561 matches), in which case, I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s too bad.</p>
