<p>OK, I&rsquo;m incredibly late to the party on this one, but I&rsquo;ve been listening to old /Filmcast podcasts and just heard about the controversy over the Hunger Games casting call for Katniss from last year:
</p><blockquote>She should be Caucasian, between ages 15 and 20, who could portray someone &ldquo;underfed but strong,&rdquo; and &ldquo;naturally pretty underneath her tomboyishness.&rdquo;</blockquote>
I&rsquo;m surprised, not that they only wanted a white actress, but that they actually said it, and it didn&rsquo;t really cause that much of a stir beyond the fan base (imagine any other industry that said &ldquo;only white people need apply&rdquo;). This <a href="http://www.eonline.com/news/the_awful_truth/hunger_games_casting_controversy/228932">EOnline article</a> was more cheery than outraged (&ldquo;what do you guys think?&rdquo;)

People seemed as much upset over the &ldquo;underfed&rdquo; requirement. I won&rsquo;t dismiss that criticism, but the story is about kids fighting to the death over food. Katniss, however, is described in the book as having dark hair and olive skin (not that Hollywood is known for staying faithful to source material, or facts, anyway). So if you&rsquo;re a skinny non-white teen actress and can&rsquo;t even get a shot at this role, you&rsquo;ve got to be thinking, what does it take to get a job in this town?
