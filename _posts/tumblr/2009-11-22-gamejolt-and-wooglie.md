I decided to try putting [HyperBowl](http://hyperbowl3d.com/) on some web game portals. Only a few support [Unity](http://unity3d.com/) right now, but the number is growing. On opposite sides of the spectrum, [Unicade](http://unicade.unifycommunity.com/) was one of the first but doesn’t do any ad-revenue sharing and it’s hard to tell if it’s maintained, anymore. [Shockwave](http://shockwave.com/) also featured a Unity game early on, but they’re submission process is like, “we’ll get back to you.” [EditorialD](http://editoriald.com/) is the new kid on the block, but it seems like they’re still figuring things out.

So I settled on [GameJolt](http://gamejolt.com/online/games/action/hyperbowl-classic/1091/) and [Wooglie](http://www.wooglie.com/playgame.php?gameID=123) for now. They both feature convenient developer account registration and game uploads. GameJolt is a bit more inviting - there’s no wait for approval and they explicitly invite works-in-progress. Wooglie doesn’t show your game until it’s approved, although the approval takes place quickly, and they just introduced a work-in-progress category. Both have nice displays of your current income generated, which is a lot more reassuring than just trusting someone to pay you according to some hidden numbers.

GameJolt is more polished, even though the site says “beta” - it has a nice clean look, even with ads, and developer-friendly features like video uploading and a news section for each game. Wooglie looks a bit more like your typical ad-crammed site and could use some refinement - the comment field is just one line and I saw a web-server error embedded in there at one point. Wooglie also has a slower web player load time (it’s not too bad, at least it lets me test the load-progress display on my web player!). On GameJolt for some reason, my logo display seems a little stuttery.

GameJolt seems to have a lot more traffic, but the downside is you have to compete with a lot of games, mostly non-Unity, and after you submit a game, it get buried pretty fast. Wooglie is Unity-only, so if you submit right now, chances are you’ll show up on the front page.
