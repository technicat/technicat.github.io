One reason I like to use [Unity](http://unity3d.com/) for mobile development is that if my app gets rejected by Apple I can still deploy it on Android (of course, I had to pay for a Unity Android license for this option!) Case in point: for while one of my to-do items has been to try out some comic book reader software on mobile devices since I know some indie comics people who might be interested in digital distribution. Recently, I found an [iPad comic book reader](http://www.codestore.co.uk/#comic) which, while I wouldn’t call it the best viewer out there, is fairly easy to use and inexpensive, so I gave it a whirl with a public domain comic from the [Digital Comic Museum](http://digitalcomicmuseum.com/).

Good thing the software was inexpensive, since I just got a rejection from Apple stating that since it’s basically a book, it has to be published in EPUB format on the Apple bookstore. Oh, well, back to my Unity apps…
