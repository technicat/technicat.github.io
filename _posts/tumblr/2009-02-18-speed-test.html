<p>After receiving two consecutive monthly increases in my cable internet bill, I decided to check my broadband speed on the <a href="http://www.speakeasy.net/speedtest/">Speakeasy Speed Test page.</a> It has a nice presentation and nifty animation when running the test.</p>

<p>Now I can reset assured I&rsquo;m paying for the &ldquo;standard&rdquo; tier (surprisingly difficult to discern from all my receipts and bills), and now I know why my ftp uploads take forever.</p>
