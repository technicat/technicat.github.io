<p>Over the holidays, I was startled to see a box titled Unity Remote on the Apple Store shelves. Turns out it&rsquo;s a bluetooth doohickey that turns an iOS device into a universal remote. I showed enough interest in it that my sister got it for me as a Christmas present. It&rsquo;s got some rough edges - I&rsquo;ve had to reestablish the bluetooth connection in Settings several times, and I have some quibbles with the user interface. Also, my TV went blank, apparently permanently, while I was trying it out, but I switched to backup monitor and it seems fine since, so chalk up the hardware failure to age and coincidence. It works well enough that I&rsquo;ve lost my remote again, and so far I haven&rsquo;t had to look for it.</p>
