Just catching up on inflicting my holiday picture on everyone. This Christmas I took my first road trip up the coast in maybe ten years. Setting aside the 2 Â½ hours it took to get by LA, it was worth it. The first photo is at the Ragged Point Inn south of Big Sur. I spent the afternoon there sitting with a cliffside ocean view and reading comic books. The second photo is of El Capitan State Beach on my way back, just north of Santa Barbara.
