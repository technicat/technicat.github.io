title: Hi, I've got a question! Does it affect your sales if one were to buy manga
  online (for instance, on rightstuf or off of barnes and nobles online store) as
  opposed to going in store to buy the manga? Because I prefer to buy my manga in
  bulk online, but I've noticed that the manga sold online is typically cheaper than
  the manga sold in stores. So, I was just wondering if you prefer customers to buy
  in store or online (due to the money difference maybe, I'm not sure how the industry
  works lol).

As long as you buy a copy, we’re happy. In general, we offer the same discount to online retailers and brick-and-mortar stores. Online retailers have lower overhead and can often offer lower prices, but they pay us the same amount for the book.

The only thing that makes us like brick-and-mortar stores over online retailers is that they need to fill physical shelf space, so they typically need to buy more copies to do that. That’s one of the reasons Barnes & Noble is by a significant margin our largest single customer.

But as I said, from a consumer perspective, your choice of retailer doesn’t really matter to us all that much.
