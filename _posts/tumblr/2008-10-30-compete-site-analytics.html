<p>I&rsquo;m a sucker for graphs, including site popularity graphs. Here&rsquo;s  a graph of visits to my web sites from the <a href="http://siteanalytics.compete.com/">Compete Site Analytics</a> page:</p>

<p><a href="http://itshardtofondlepenguins.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/picture-5.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1117" title="picture-5" src="http://itshardtofondlepenguins.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/picture-5.png" alt="" width="500" height="268"/></a></p>

<p>The<a href="http://technicat.com/"> technicat</a> site has been pretty steady the last few years, but my <a href="http://philipchu.com/">personal site</a> didn&rsquo;t even register. This blog has only been around half a year, but looks like it also might have flatlined except for a late spike, probably due to one day of 4000 hits from <a href="http://reddit.com/">reddit</a>, during yet another thread on design patterns.</p>

<p>Lest I indulge solely in web site narcissism, here&rsquo;s a chart comparing three other sites, <a href="http://benkoo.com/">Koo&rsquo;s Corner</a>, <a href="http://bikemecca.com/">Bike Mecca</a>, and <a href="http://wordseye.com/">WordsEye</a>.</p>
