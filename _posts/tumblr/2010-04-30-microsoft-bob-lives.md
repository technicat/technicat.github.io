Popups have evolved from just popping up to jumping in front of you. In some cases, they are “nice” enough to only pop up when your mouse moves over them (the evil twin of tooltips), in which case you end up playing a browser game called Avoid-the-Hotspot. Here’s one that jumps in over the reading area from the right. Surprise!

Worse are the ones that abandon restraint and just say “Here I am. Look at me! Look at me! It’s time for my close-up, Mr. Demille!” I ran into this popup while scrolling down and trying to read the article - and of course it pops up right where you’re trying to read. It’s as if those ubiquitous television badges (reminding you that you’re watching “Syfy”!) were placed in the center of the TV screen instead of the corner.

From an advertising perspective I suppose it might be considered effective in that you can’t ignore it (you could say the same about a punch in the face), but I make a point of not “sharing” those sites via Twitter or whatever - I’m not going to inflict that on anyone else.
