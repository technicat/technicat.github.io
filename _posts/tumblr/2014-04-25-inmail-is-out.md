I’ve complained so much about LinkedIn recruiter spam, it’s long overdue that I finally changed my LinkedIn settings to block InMail messages (in the Privacy-\>Communications section). InMail is basically LinkedIn’s paid spam service:

If you want to cost recruiters money, you can reply to every InMail (they get refunded if there are no replies), but then LinkedIn makes money off it. Or you can just block it.
