<p>I stopped supporting ARMv6 devices a while ago (I&rsquo;m still building fat binaries with ARMv6 support on iOS, but that&rsquo;s just because the App Store submission process won&rsquo;t let me drop previous ARMv6 support - practically speaking, the recent iOS&rsquo;s don&rsquo;t run on those devices anyway). However, during some Unity code cleanup I found the function that I used on iOS and Android to perform a runtime check to see if I was running on ARMv6 and thus needed to deactivate some content to run with decent performance. I&rsquo;m tossing that code out, but here it is, if you ever need it:</p>

<p><code><br/>
static function IsARM6() {<br/>
return (SystemInfo.processorType.IndexOf("ARMv6")&gt;-1);<br/>
}<br/></code></p>
