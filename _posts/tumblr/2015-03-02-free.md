[![Free: The Future of a Radical Price](https://d.gr-assets.com/books/1425190646m/6150530.jpg)](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6150530-free)[Free: The Future of a Radical Price](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6150530-free) by [Chris Anderson](https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/1756.Chris_Anderson)  
My rating: [3 of 5 stars](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1192487915)  
  
Like the author’s well-known book The Long Tail, I felt this topic would have been fine as a Wired article but was artificially stretched to fill out a book, citing anything remotely related to free, even includin the term “free lunch” as an example, and like other works of this ilk, breathlessly extolling the new world order while understating the challenges this poses to those who reside in the “long tail.” Ironically, I found this book in the bargain section of Office Depot.
