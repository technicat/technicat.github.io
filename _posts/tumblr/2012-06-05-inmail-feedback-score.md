Today I decided to go through all the recruiter messages in my LinkedIn inbox and provide a feedback score, since I noticed each sender has an “InMail Feedback Score”. But I couldn’t find any way to provide a rating, so I googled for help, and now I feel deceived. While I’ve been feeling honored to receive messages from all these 5-star rated recruiters, turns out you get five stars if you can just get nine people to not completely ignore you (that’s what LinkedIn calls a “positive response”). If only getting five-star app ratings was that easy.
