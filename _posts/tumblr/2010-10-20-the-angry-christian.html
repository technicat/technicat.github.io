<p>Back in the &lsquo;90s, I was in a Ralph&rsquo;s, waiting behind a customer who clearly had more than the number of items you&rsquo;re supposed to bring into the express lane. Instead of just pretending he couldn&rsquo;t read or count, he ranted at the cashier that the other lines were too long, and thus it was the store&rsquo;s fault that he was holding up this line. This stuck in my mind because of a) the logic, b) I figured his two little kids watching this display were destined for a lifetime of therapy, and c) during his rant, he described himself as &ldquo;an angry Christian&rdquo;.</p>

<p>I recalled this recently after distributing some promo codes for one of my iPhone/iPad apps. It&rsquo;s an oddity of the app market that the nastiest comments originate from people who didn&rsquo;t even pay for the app. I was curious enough about one angry reviewer who ran into an iOS4 crash bug (didn&rsquo;t play nicely, literally, with mp3 audio in a Unity 3 beta release) who said he was never going to buy anything from me (if &ldquo;buy&rdquo; means take another promo code, fine with me), that I googled for him. (&ldquo;You are not invisible&rdquo;, as I remember a coworker broadcasting when office muffins were taken). Turns out the guy was a Christian missionary.</p>

<p>Obviously, there are plenty of angry Muslims in the world (fatwa, anyone?), but I haven&rsquo;t met any, except the pizza maker in Baltimore who seemed distressed when I told him I&rsquo;m an atheist (he asked for my religion, and I guess he would have accepted any answer except none). No angry Jews, either. But I&rsquo;ve met quite a few angry Christians. And they make me nervous.</p>
