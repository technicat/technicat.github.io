One of the more polished iPhone apps (featured in on one of the Apple ads) is from [UrbanSpoon](http://urbanspoon.com/) - shake your device, the display spins and clicks like a slot machine and settles on a random eatery in your vicinity.

But after a couple of days trying it out, it seemed to be repeating itself, and so far had only shown me one restaurant I haven’t visited. That, and driving around, you might think Huntington Beach is a wasteland of strip malls with Del Tacos, Sizzler’s and Starbucks, but it’s really not that bad. It’s no Manhattan, but if I decide to do strike a blow against global warming and dependence on Middle East (or Canadian, for that matter) oil, I have quite a few options for lunch within a mile - decent Thai, Japanese, barbeque (although the folks at [The Front Porch BBQ](http://tfphb.com/) didn’t know what I was talking about when I asked for fried okra) and a pretty good breakfast/lunch place called the Good Day Cafe.

Unfortunately, Chinese isn’t well represented (it seems any place with “Wok” in the name doesn’t hold much promise). But if I venture further to the next strip mall, there’s yet another Thai place (last count I’ve been to seven in the HB area) called Sea Siam and a very good Japanese place, [Slowfish](http://slowfishusa.com/), where I can get ramen, udon, and eel on rice.

And then on the way back, to cool off after a spicey seafood ramen, I can get a $1 scoop of Aztec chocolate or mint with chili powder ice cream at Znow’s, which somehow, in an out-of-the way strip mall next to a Quizno’s and Starbucks, made it on the radar to be named [OC Weekly’s Best of OC Ice Cream.](http://www.ocweekly.com/bestof/2008/award/best-ice-cream-256718/)

Oddly, HB residents don’t seem all that adventurous about dining, or at least walking to dining. One of my neighbors didn’t recognize any of the restaurants I named. And when I first moved here for work, my coworkers just ate at the Westminster mall food court. But I’m not much of a culinary explorer compared to the[twelve-year old New York food critic](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/17/nyregion/17bigcity.html?_r=2&scp=1&oref=slogin).
