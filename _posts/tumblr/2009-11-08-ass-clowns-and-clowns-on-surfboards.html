<p>Before you type in that search term, be aware it might show up on a big scrolling display in Google HQ. Don&rsquo;t believe me? Well, search terms show up in web site access logs, too. I don&rsquo;t know if they indicate more about the searcher or the site being searched. My <a href="http://technicat.com/">technica</a>t site has several software engineering essays, and I get search terms in the vein of &ldquo;what to do about a stupid boss&rdquo;.
