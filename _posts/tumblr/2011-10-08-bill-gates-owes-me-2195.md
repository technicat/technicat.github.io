Update: due to a class action suit, I got a few bucks back a little while back. You’re off the hook, Bill!

_Originally written on Epinions in November 2003:_

Let me state right off the bat that I never used MSN Internet Access, but apparently I had an account and they billed me for it. And I want my money back.

This fiasco originated last year at Best Buy, where I bought an Alienware PC. That ordeal is stuff for another review, but during that process, the person who took my credit card informed me that a free six months of MSN internet access was included with my purchase. When I said that I already had internet access, she assured me that Microsoft would not automatically start charging me after six months.

Now I’m wondering if they get a cut from Microsoft (right, they get no commissions), because six months later I found a $21.95 charge from Microsoft on my credit card bill. I called up, got transferred around before ending up at the billing department (I had to yell, “No, don’t transfer me back” to avoid getting stuck in a phone-transfer loop), where the representative seemed to understand that I never wanted the account, never used it, and wanted a refund. The fact that I didn’t even know my login name seemed to support my argument.

But then, victory seemingly within my grasp, I was transferred to another, more robotic, representative who steadily repeated that it was not company policy to refund the charge. Rather than try to find my way back to the previous rep, I called my credit card backer and stated my case. After filling out some forms, I got satisfaction a month or so later when my charge card was credited with the disputed amount. But in the meantime, adding insult to injury, Microsoft charged me one more time.

So they still owe me $21.95. Pay up!
