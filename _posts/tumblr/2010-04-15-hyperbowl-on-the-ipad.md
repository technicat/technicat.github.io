I got a nice birthday present this week - the latest version of [HyperBowl, with native support for the iPad](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/hyperbowl/id344209253?mt=8), was approved and showed up on the App Store. It took two submissions, the first one rejected because I didn’t support both portrait and portrait upside-down orientations, but overall it still just took a few days to get through. Development-wise, it took a couple of days to get it running on the iPad while verifying that it still ran on the iPhone (since this is a “universal” build instead of a separate iPad-only app).

The iPad version is a bit faster than the iPhone, although I had to make some tweaks to avoid some performance killers, in particular removing fog from the Forest lane. I’m sad to see it go, but the original HyperBowl didn’t have fog, either, and and the increased resolution is a good tradeoff. At 768x1024, this might be the highest-resolution HyperBowl yet! (the original PC game was running in a 448x588 section of a 1024x768 screen). I was tempted to follow the current trend and name it HyperBowl HD! But I didn’t.

As with the previous iPhone release, this version supports the Scoreloop social gaming network. I search for “Scoreloop” on my iPad App Store, HyperBowl is the only iPad game that shows up. I’m pretty sure it’s not really the only one, or the first, but I’m not complaining.
