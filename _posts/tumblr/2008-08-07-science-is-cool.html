<p>Science is cool these days. I know this because it&rsquo;s on TV - prime time, no less.</p>

<p>This first occurred to me when <a href="http://www.scifi.com/eureka/">Eureka</a> went on the air, and again when it wasn&rsquo;t cancelled. Somehow, the network that produces numerous cheap CG dragons and heavily promotes <a href="http://www.scifi.com/ghosthunters/">Ghost Hunters</a> comes up with an occasional gem (<a href="http://www.scifi.com/battlestar/">Battlestar Galactica</a>). But despite the name of the network, Eureka isn&rsquo;t really sci-fi, it&rsquo;s an hour-long science appreciation show.  Geniuses living together in an isolated yet idyllic community, working on blue-sky projects while munching on free gourmet meals (sounds like a Google recruiting pitch). Not all are nerdy, but most are eccentric enough to fit in at Comic-con, and some are even good-looking, but not unbelievably so (at least with a slight stretch of imagination)</p>

<p>But there are other current shows which glamorize science, many of which involve crime, for some reason. Numbers, CSI, NCIS, Bones&hellip;to varying extents they all feature really techy people who are nerdy enough to assure us they must be really good at their stuff. <a href="http://www.cbs.com/primetime/big_bang_theory/">The Big Bang Theory</a> wins the prize for the nerdiest cast of all, but despite that and the goofy intro song, it&rsquo;s not nearly as awful as I expected, and it somehow still comes off as a celebration of nerdiness. As with the other shows, the science and nerd culture references sound accurate enough that you&rsquo;d think there must be some ex-physics grad students on the writing staff. Versus standard sci-fi fare, all these shows let you say, &ldquo;ah, that&rsquo;s what a forensic examiner/physicist/mathematician does&rdquo; (insert &ldquo;good-looking&rdquo; where appropriate)</p>

<p>And lest you think that the extreme displays of nerdiness don&rsquo;t exit in real life, there&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.cwtv.com/shows/beauty-and-the-geek">Beauty and the Geek</a>. (take the cast of The Big Bang Theory and parachute them into the Playboy mansion with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Girls_Next_Door">The Girls Next Door</a>, you get the idea) But if you want to see real scientific brains in action (&ldquo;reality show&rdquo; is an oxymoron, anyway), there&rsquo;s a growing number of entertaining real science shows, like PBS&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.pbs.org/kcet/wiredscience/">Wired Science</a>,  and <a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/sciencenow/"> Nova Science Now<br/></a> hosted by the energetic <a href="http://research.amnh.org/~tyson/">Neil deGrasse Tyson.<br/></a></p>
