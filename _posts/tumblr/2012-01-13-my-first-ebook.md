Now that I have a NOOK Color for app development and probably will have to buy a Kindle Fire, too, I figured I might as well see what’s involved in self-publishing ebooks on those platforms. At first, I looked at [Smashwords](http://smashwords.com/), which has the convenience of upload-one-publish-everywhere, where everywhere includes iBooks, Nook and Kindle. It’s free, except you have to obtain an ISBN for iBooks, which will cost a few bucks of you get it from Smashwords. But you have to upload your book in Word format.

So I’m trying out the Barnes and Noble [PubIt](http://pubit.barnesandnoble.com/) self-publishing program. Also free, no ISBN required, and it supports a variety of upload formats, preferably ePub (which is what everything else converts to). So for my first attempt, I collected all my [Technicat essays](http://technicat.com/writing), pasted them into Apple Pages and formatted the document with the sample ePub styles provided by Apple for use in creating iBooks, then exported and submitted it. Overall, it’s a heck of a lot easier than submitting an app! Not to mention you don’t have to go through an app review period. But from the number of new releases just for today, I can see it’s even harder to stand out from the crowd - it took me a while to realize that [my book](http://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/technicat-on-software-phil-chu/1108218697) actually showed up on the store yesterday. To my relief, the book looks a lot better on the device than in Pages, and the TOC shows up properly in the Contents menu, but I can’t believe after all these years I still have errors in the text! That’s one good thing about self-publishing ebooks, as with apps - it’s easy to update.

Here’s the promotional badge that can be obtained from the [PubIt forum](http://bookclubs.barnesandnoble.com/t5/PubIt-Help-Board/Add-a-Pubit-Badge-to-Your-Site-or-Blog-that-Links-Back-to-Your/m-p/719705/message-uid/719705#U719705) (which is well worth browsing before you try publishing a book):
