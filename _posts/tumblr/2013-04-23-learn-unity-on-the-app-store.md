I have yet another [HyperBowl](http://hyperbowl3d.com/)-style bowling game on the App Store, called [Learn Unity](http://itunes.apple.com/app/learn-unity/id634845779), since this is the game built following my book in-progress, [Learn Unity 4 for iOS Game Development](http://learnunity4.com/). Besides the name (maybe I should have called it something like Unity Bowl), the game is a bit odd since it uses conveniently free assets from the Unity Asset Store. That’s why it’s bowling for barrels and the barrels sound like coins (the video game kind).
