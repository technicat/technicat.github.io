<p>One drawback of year-round good weather here in Southern California is the year-round visitation of door-to-door salespeople. When I first moved here, it was a novelty to chat with a couple of teens sent out by their &ldquo;church&rdquo; to sell magazines. Over a decade later, it&rsquo;s getting pretty old. In a fit of pique, after getting rousted off my sofa by representatives of the Orange County Register, I sent this email complaint (took a while - the complaint submission form didn&rsquo;t work, so I had to try the direct email link, at the risk of ending up on a spam list).

</p><blockquote>Â I know this complaint won&rsquo;t have any effect, but please don&rsquo;t send kids or young adults around knocking on doors pushing subscriptions, particularly in gated areas marked No Soliciting. Your representatives offered a free issue which would have been fine, but then they kept trying to get me to sign up for a subscription immediately - this is my day off after a long work week and I shouldn&rsquo;t have to stand at my door repeatedly saying no and then getting a &ldquo;you&rsquo;re missing out, bud&rdquo; at the end. This just guarantees that not only won&rsquo;t I buy a subscription, I&rsquo;ll make a point of not buying your paper off the rack. No wonder print journalism is dying.</blockquote>

To their credit, the OC Register responded the next day apologizing and saying they would forward my complaint to the head of contractor services. I&rsquo;m sure they will then review their whole marketing strategy and it&rsquo;s dependence on door-to-door salespeople (and consider why they share that space only with magazines and Girl Scout cookies), or perhaps institute a training program that inculcates ethical and courteous sales tactics. Or maybe not.

I confess I fibbed a bit in my complaint for effect. I didn&rsquo;t have a really long week, Saturday isn&rsquo;t really my day off, and I stopped buying the OC Register years ago after all those telemarketing calls (besides, the LA Times is a much better paper). And the last delivery guy was arrested for peeping in my complex, so I&rsquo;m not in a hurry to hire his replacement.
