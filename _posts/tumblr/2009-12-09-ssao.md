I finally got around to trying out one of the feature introduced in [Unity](http://unity3d.com/) 2.6 - the [SSAO](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screen_Space_Ambient_Occlusion) effect.

Without SSAO:

and with SSAO:

The effect is subtle, particularly with the existing shadow, but it’s there. There’s about a 10% frame rate hit on my MacBook Pro, so I guess I’ll keep it.
