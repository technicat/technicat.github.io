<p>I finally got around to releasing an ad-free version of Fugu Maze on the Android Market, called <a href="https://market.android.com/details?id=com.technicat.FuguMazePro">Fugu Maze Pro</a>. The download stats still seem to be broken (for a week, now). The dashboard shows I already have more active users than downloads (and that&rsquo;s zero percent?)</p>
