I saw [Immerz](http://www.immerz.com/) at E3 last week and gave it a try. It’s primarily designed to work with FPS games, but since it plugs into anything with an audio output jack, I whipped out my iPad and tried with [HyperBowl](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/hyperbowl/id344209253?mt=8). It worked surprisingly well - you can feel the rumbling on your chest as the ball rolls, and the 3D audio sources (including the pins!) sound great.

I wonder how well it would work with the footstep and suspense sounds in [Fugu Maze](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/fugu-maze/id295808255?mt=8). Now I’m thinking about putting in a heartbeat sound…
