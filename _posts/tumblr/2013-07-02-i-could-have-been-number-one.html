<p>I was all excited that <a href="http://learnunity4.com/">my book</a> reached number three this weekend on the Kindle Computer Games Programming ranking (setting aside that like the App Store there are probably enough categories to ensure you&rsquo;re ranked in one of them). But then I took a closer look at the competing titles. That book at number one is only incidentally relevant to game programming. And Minecraft? For Dummies? At least that Python book at number four is about programming, but not game programming (Python rarely is). So, no fair.</p>
