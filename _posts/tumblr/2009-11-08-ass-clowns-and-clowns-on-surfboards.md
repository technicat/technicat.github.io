Before you type in that search term, be aware it might show up on a big scrolling display in Google HQ. Don’t believe me? Well, search terms show up in web site access logs, too. I don’t know if they indicate more about the searcher or the site being searched. My [technica](http://technicat.com/)t site has several software engineering essays, and I get search terms in the vein of “what to do about a stupid boss”. The search terms for this blog is a mish-mash. Here’s a recent list showing my audience includes Alyson Hannigan fans, linguists (“ass clown etymology”) and those who for some reason want to see a clown on a surfboard.
