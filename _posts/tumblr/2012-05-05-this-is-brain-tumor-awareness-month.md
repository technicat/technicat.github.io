May is [Brain Tumor Awareness Month](http://www.braintumor.org/get-involved/advocacy-public-policy/BTAM.html), and I’m more keenly aware of this than I might otherwise be, as I just attended a very moving and inspirational Celebration of Life for a friend’s husband who passed away recently from brain cancer. His [obituary](http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/orangecounty/obituary.aspx?n=gabriel-pace-mark&pid=157350111) just gives a hint of the amazing selfless spirit he exhibited during this ordeal. Another friend is participating in a [Livestrong ride](http://laf.livestrong.org/site/TR?px=1035632&pg=personal&fr_id=1182&et=WD1LeRf_iVY3bCDOeQum-w&s_tafId=1507) in his honor.
