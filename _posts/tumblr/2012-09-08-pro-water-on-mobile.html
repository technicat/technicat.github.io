<p>The Pro Water that comes with Unity has been working on mobile for a while (Unity 3.4?) but I only just got around to trying it on iOS. Here I have it running in my next update to the <a href="http://hyperbowl3d.com/">HyperBowl</a> Classic lane. There&rsquo;s a significant performance hit, but in this case the water is not activated unless you bypass the bowling pins, so I think I&rsquo;ll keep it because it just looks so good.</p>
