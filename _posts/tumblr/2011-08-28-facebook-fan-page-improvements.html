<p>While I was updating my <a href="http://hyperbowl3d.com/">HyperBowl</a> site to make room for a <a href="http://www.unity-insider.de/vorgestellt/app-check/585-hyperbowl">new review from Unity Insider</a>, I decided to take another look at adding a Facebook badge for the <a href="http://facebook.com/hyperbowl">HyperBowl fan page</a>, since there&rsquo;s some room on the sidebar, and the simple web badge I had there is kind of dull and easy to ignore (it looks like all my other Facebook web badges, but they point to different fan pages!). I avoided the official badge before due to its size and its display of fans&rsquo; profile photos. I guess it bothered some other people, too, as I see that&rsquo;s now not an option. It also looks better - simpler and cleaner, and fits in better on my page sidebar.</p>

<p>I also decided to check out the Facebook Insights for the fan page, and that&rsquo;s also much improved, with a lot more graphs, including aggregate user info, which I suppose might bother some people, but I do find the information interesting, like this one:</p>
