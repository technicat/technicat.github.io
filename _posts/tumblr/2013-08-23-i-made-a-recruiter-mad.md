> I don’t understand, are you being angry because I asked for a resume?&nbsp; What did I do wrong?&nbsp; You’re trying to make me regret asking you for a word version.&nbsp; Everyone does that.&nbsp; You’re being a jerk and not willing to compromise.&nbsp; I don’t get what your problem is.&nbsp; You’re being rude.&nbsp; You don’t respond that way to a simple request like I did something wrong.&nbsp; You owe me an apology.&nbsp; That was way out of line.

This was in response to “I’m not interested. Please take me off your contact list.” Which came after “Never mind. Thanks for your time.”
