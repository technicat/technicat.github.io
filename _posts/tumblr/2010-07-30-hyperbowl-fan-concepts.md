Some of the enjoyable responses for my games include ideas for additional content (one enthusiastic reviewer for [Fugu Games](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/fugu-maze/id295808255?mt=8) had enough suggestions to turn it into Resident Evil!) A [HyperBowl](http://hyperbowl3d.com/) player even sent me some concept art for new HyperBowl lanes (thanks, Ischa!)
