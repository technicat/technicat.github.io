As I rewatched [Band of Brothers](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0185906/) this weekend, once again I just couldn’t believe that just before the paratroopers took off for the D-Day invasion, they were given new 80-pound bags to strap on their legs that they had never trained with. A last-minute inspiration from HQ that would supposedly provide them with more equipment and weaponry when they landed. As you might expect from a last-minute untested idea, it didn’t work well - after lugging around that extra weight, much of it was lost during the jumps, anyway.

This can’t-leave-well-enough-alone is common in software projects, too, although of course with less drastic consequences. Software is just too easy to change, and most people view what programmers do as “magic”. Abracadabra! On many projects I’ve suggested or argued for a slowdown, in fact micromanagement, of changes as a product approaches release, but in practice that’s mostly resulted in a bunch of meetings before release in which every idea for a change was approved. One company that made a big deal about process (ISO 9000 and all that) was proud of having hardcopy change orders that needed sign-offs, but those changes involved whole feature sets! A manager at another company didn’t even bother to pretend to understand - everyone would cram in as many changes as possible into a milestone release, the publisher would receive something severely buggy or crashing, the manager would throw a fit about why people couldn’t be more careful, and then when I proposed a “freeze” before release, she’d complain, “but then we can’t change anything”. Duh. It’s called risk management. If you could really throw in stuff without testing and get away with it, we wouldn’t need all these alpha and beta releases, or a QA staff, for that matter.

The last-minute tweak. Just don’t do it.
