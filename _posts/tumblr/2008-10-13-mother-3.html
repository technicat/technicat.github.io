<p>This month, I noticed a lot of hits on an old <a href="http://www.technicat.com/games/whirltourgc.html">game development postmortem</a> that Nintendo published on their developer site (after I submitted it to Game Developer Magazine and got no response). Turns out it&rsquo;s from the blog of the <a href="http://mother3.fobby.net/">Mother 3 Fan Translation Project</a>. I&rsquo;ve never heard of the project or Mother 3, but coincidentally, theÂ  latest issue of <a href="http://www.playmagazine.com/">Play Magazine</a> (my favorite video game periodical, despite the surprising number of typos) had a big feature on it. Apparently, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mother_3">Mother 3</a> is a hugely popular GBA game that was published only in Japan, and devotees have been working on an unofficial (and technically illegal, at least to install) translation. Interestingly, Nintendo has no official interest in an official translation yet unofficially encourages the unofficial translation, and according to the Play article, that is typical of the game publishers&rsquo; approach, similar to the fan cultivation in anime. Nice to see some friendly non-litigation in this industry!</p>
