<p>Just a followup on yesterday&rsquo;s blog on checking the Unity build log to see which assets you&rsquo;re really using. The build log lists assets in descending order of file size, which is great when you&rsquo;re optimizing the build size and not so great when you want to compare the list with what you&rsquo;ve got in your Unit project directory. However, the Mac Console has a convenient text search box that shows filtered results, so if you arrange your assets in appropriate directories (putting them all in one top-level directory is not going to help you), you can simplify the comparison. For example, I placed all the sounds that can be used for the <a href="http://hyperbowl3d.com/">HyperBowl</a> bowling ball in the directory Sounds/Ball, so after a build, I can select Unity Editor.log file in the Console, type &ldquo;Sounds/Ball&rdquo; in the Console search field, and here it lists what is actually used from that directory in my Unity Assets folder.</p>
