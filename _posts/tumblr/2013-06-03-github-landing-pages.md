A really cool feature of GitHub is the landing page that’s provided with each repo. I’m taking advantage of it for my [Unity iOS book](http://learnunity4.com/), since I have the book examples on GitHub, anyway. Among the conveniences, easy authoring (markdown format and an assortment of themes), and quick links to download a zip of the distribution or visit the repo. I’m having trouble settling on a theme, though, so I’ve been alternating.
