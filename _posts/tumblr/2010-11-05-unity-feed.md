[Unity Feed](http://itunes.apple.com/app/unity-feed/id400855804?mt=8), a compilation of Unity RSS feeds, is now on the App Store. I created this as a test of [AppMakr](http://appmakr.com/), but it’s actually something I thought I’d find useful for myself, since there are no so many disparate official Unity channels - news, blogs, the forum, the feedback/feature site, the answers (stackoverflow-style) site…and in fact I do use the app on my iPod touch to check on Unity news while I’m vegetating on the couch.
