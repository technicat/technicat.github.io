<p>Apple must have staffed up for the holidays - my last round of <a href="http://hyperbowl3d.com/">HyperBowl</a> updates took less than a week to get approved, and the new apps took maybe a week and a half, despite getting a call from Apple that I needed to remove the text about the seasonal donation to <a href="http://get-well-gamers.org/">Get Well Gamers</a> from the App Store description (the rep said it was &ldquo;great&rdquo; but they just don&rsquo;t allow it to be promoted on the App Store). These releases also coincided with some App Store changes. Conveniently, they now automatically set the Release or Update date to the approval date. But the New Releases listings only show new releases, not updates, which makes it hard to get noticed without constantly releasing new apps (which does vindicate my decision to release the HyperBowl lanes individually). On the other hand, now the New Releases list is a lot less crowded, so new releases don&rsquo;t get immediately obscured as much.</p>

<p>Anyway, here&rsquo;s the third lane, <a href="http://itunes.com/app/hyperbowlforest">HyperBowl Forest</a>:</p>

<p>and a compilation of all three lanes so far, simply named <a href="http://itunes.com/app/hyperbowl">HyperBowl</a>:</p>
