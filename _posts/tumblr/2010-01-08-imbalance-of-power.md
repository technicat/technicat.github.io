While Apple crows about 100,000+ apps on the App Store, it’s not necessarily great news for iPhone developers. Even before that milestone was reached, I can tell it’s a buyer’s market just from the emails sent by app review sites There’s the unsolicited requests for promo codes, without even an assurance that they’ll write a review, or an acknowledgment if you do send some codes. Even the cheapskates on toucharcade will throw you a thank-you.

> We are interested in playing HyperBowl Classic, and I was wondering if you might have a promo code or two available for this purpose (please keep in mind that we may or may not review the game after playing).

The more professional sites make a point of not begging for codes, but they all expect you to provide one if you’re asking for a review. And if you want a review bad enough, you can buy one.

> We get more review requests than we can possibly handle, so if you’d like an assured review on our site, please consider our expedited review offer, priced at a nominal $20.

Back when I worked on a CG software product, I heard we couldn’t get a review in a magazine until we bought an ad. I guess things haven’t changed.

> Thank you for the information, we’ll take a look at the app. Would you be interested in our advertising options?

This one isn’t from a review site, but I like the “simple” model - instead of just giving away your app with promo codes or just making it free for a while, you can actually pay a company to give it away for you. I guess you’ll make it up in volume.

> Our model is simple. We have dedicated users that want paid iPhone apps for free.&nbsp; You foot the bill for the cost of your own app (which you get 70% back from Apple) plus our service fee.&nbsp; In return you get new users to buy your paid app from iTunes, write real unbiased reviews, and most importantly increase your download count which helps push up your rankings in your app category.&nbsp; In addition, you get real customer feedback quickly
