The iPad is a nice web-browsing appliance, Flash aside, but I found my <a href="http://hyperbowl3d.com/">HyperBowl</a> site was scrunched in it, quite possibly because I had this in the HTML header as a trick to specially format it for the iPhone:
<pre>&lt;meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width"/&gt;</pre>
So where I had a CSS for the iPhone and another for everything else, I now have one more CSS for the iPad. The order is important.
<pre>&lt;link href="hyper2.css" type="text/css" rel="stylesheet"&gt;
&lt;link media="only screen and (max-device-width: 1024px)"
 href="hyperipad.css" type="text/css" rel="stylesheet" /&gt;
&lt;link media="only screen and (max-device-width: 480px)"
 href="hyperiphone.css" type="text/css" rel="stylesheet" /&gt;</pre>
