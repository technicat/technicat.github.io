I’ve decided to start building my Android apps with the Android 2.2 SDK as a target, i.e. the minimum requirement, since that’s the lowest Android version I test with. Based on the stats I have for HyperBowl Lite, it looks like I could lose a bit under 3% of my customer base. But that might be compensated by all the Samsung Galaxy S devices with Android 2.1 that can’t run Unity and are basically one-star app rating generators.
