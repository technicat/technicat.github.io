I’m not much a picture taker at Comic Con, but I got a few. Lured by free pizza, I attended a screening of Axe Cop. Numerous Axe Cops were on the scene:

Prior to the screening, some gems like Fring Breakers passed the time:

I’ve only talked to celebrities twice at Comic Con. The first was Herb Jefferson, “the original Boomer”, and this time I met Lea Thompson (if I was dressed up as Howard the Duck, it would have been perfect!)

I’ve learned a few veteran Con moves by now. One is, the best bathrooms are in the hotels, in particular the second floor of the Hilton, and the one by second floor restaurant in the Marriott. Also in the Marriott, the film and anime rooms are the most comfortable places to while away time until the wee hours. There is one chair by the film room that is in range of the public wifi. And the Con lounge in that area is open from 5pm-2AM and servers free soda, chips, pretzels and m&m’s. I spent an entire day watching movies and ingesting salt and sugar.
