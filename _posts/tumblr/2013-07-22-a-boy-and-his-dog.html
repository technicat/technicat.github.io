<p>I&rsquo;m a sucker for loyal dog stories. The one that gets me the most is that of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hachik%C5%8D">Hachiko</a>, with the <a href="http://www.avclub.com/articles/sad-futurama-dog-to-become-much-less-sad-with-addi,99240/">Futurama version</a> a close second. And then there&rsquo;s the Don Johnson classic (I mean that sincerely, this is his best movie), A Boy and His Dog. I saw it first in college and again at Comic Con last week. It&rsquo;s as good as I remember. This might pique your interest - it&rsquo;s based on a Harlan Ellison story. Also - telepathic dog in a post-apocalyptic world.</p>
