<p>I managed to update some web players in the brief interval between Unity 3.2 and 3.3 betas and took the opportunity to try out the Unity support from the Kongregate game portal. Up til now, GameJolt was my favorite, being very polished and allowing complete self-publishing and management (i.e. no approval process), although with so many more games to compete againsts, GameJolt is one of my least profitable platforms (though still better than sites that don&rsquo;t have any ad revenue, like my own). Kongregate is just as polished, though, and with a lot more traffic, but most of that traffic occurs within the first two days of a game debut (that&rsquo;s about as long as it stays visible in the What&rsquo;s New listing).</p>

<p>I started with <a href="http://www.kongregate.com/games/technicat/hyperbowl">HyperBowl</a>, my showcase game:</p>

<p>and followed up with <a href="http://www.kongregate.com/games/technicat/fugu-maze">Fugu Maze</a>, a much simpler game, for comparison:</p>

<p>They actually seemed to do about the same, with HyperBowl getting marginally more plays ( but that could be due to the time of day I submitted it), but Fugu Maze getting marginally better ratings, and more interesting (and varied) reviews:</p>
