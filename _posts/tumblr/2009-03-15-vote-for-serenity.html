<p>Serenity is the by far the leading vote-getter in NASA&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/externalflash/name_ISS/index.html">contest</a> to name the Node 3 addition to the Space Station, though Joss Whedon&rsquo;s Firefly/Serenity fans may be concerned about write-in&rsquo;s from Colbert Nation supporters.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.nasa.gov/externalflash/name_ISS/index.html"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1798" title="picture-7" src="http://itshardtofondlepenguins.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/picture-7.png" alt="picture-7" width="405" height="725"/></a></p>

<p>This being NASA, I think they should take in account not only how cool the Serenity spaceship looks (especially on the Blue-Ray disc I just bought at the Circuit City meltdown), but also a highly-underpraised aspect of the Firefly/Serenity universe - it&rsquo;s quiet in space! Almost all sci-fi shows from Star Trek to to Star Wars to Babylon 5 to Battlestar Galactica (old and new) feature a cacaphony of engine&rsquo;s revving, lasers (sorry, phasers) blasting and guns blazing. 2001: A Space Odyssey showed it could be done quietly and scientifically correctly, and Joss Whedon did it again, without playing the Blue Danube.</p>

<p>But I feel obligated also to point out a highly-undercriticized aspect of Joss Whedon&rsquo;s sci-fi vision - where are all the Chinese? I&rsquo;m accustomed to the lack of Asian representation in Hollywood, but this is supposed to be world spawned from a great Anglo-Chinese alliance in which everyone swears in Chinese and knows how to use chopsticks. There are so few recognizably Asian characters in the series and movie, I was startled to see an Asian face in the bonus features on the Blue-Ray disc (I guess that was a bonus!).</p>

<p>Joss Whedon&rsquo;s shows are among my favorite (still not sure about Dollhouse&hellip;), but they do have &ldquo;written by a white Hollywood screenwriter&rdquo; stamped all over them, much like Paul Haggis screenplays and half the shows on the WB. In contrast, take Battlestar Galactica - the fleet is visibly mixed-race and led by a Latino, and it&rsquo;s no big deal. Even the Cylons have gender and racial variety (just don&rsquo;t call them toasters!) Hmm, for the next Space Station addition, I hope they name it Galactica.</p>
