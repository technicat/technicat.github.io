Every since the Mac went Intel, visions of doing both my Mac and PC work on the same machine have floated through my head. I first tried that with Windows XP running on Bootcamp on the first version of the MacBook Pro, back in 2006 on a contract that required supporting Mac, Windows and even Linux versions. And it worked quite well, although booting back and forth between Mac and Windows was inconvenient, so perhaps I should have used Parallels. In fact, I did use Parallels for the Linux version. My over-priced dog-slow DSL line had succumbed to something (maybe shame), so my routine involved taking my laptop to the public library, performing the daily Linux, Mac and Windows builds, then getting lunch. Ah, the consulting life.

Now, only four years later, Parallels is up to version 5, I’m on my second MacBook Pro which is smaller, cheaper and faster, and we’ve gone from Windows XP to Windows 7 (Vista got the New Coke treatment). Now I’m on a more graphics intensive project but Parallels now supports an “enhanced” graphics mode which is supposed to support some gaming, so I gave it a try. Installing Parallels 5 was a breeze, reinstalling that old version of XP that I’d used on Bootcamp was surpisingly easy, too, if lengthy. And I was relieved that the Windows “genuine” validation went through and didn’t complain that I’d already installed it on a dead machine four years ago, which saved me a Windows 7 purchase.

The new “Coherence” mode in Parallels is slick - instead of running the entire Windows environment in a single window, the individual Windows applications are on your Mac desktop and the system menus and tray icons are similarly merged in the Mac Finder. The downside is that the Activity Monitor shows Parallels takes 2GB of memory so my 2GB MacBook Pro just churns away when I click around on different windows. The 3D support does work, to an extent. I was able to bring up my Unity-based [HyperBowl](http://hyperbowl3d.com/) web player but some of the lighting is off, and the mouse controls appear messed up. To be fair, they don’t work that well in general on Internet Explorer, which is what I tested it on. Also, my much more lightweight [Fugu Games](http://fugugames.com/) web players might have fared better. I also gave the CryEngine-based[Blue Mars](http://bluemars.com/) client a shot, but that crashed Parallels. However, the Blue Mars FAQ does say that some people have successfully run it with Parallels, so maybe I just need some more horsepower (hardware power).
