<p>Staying at the hip and trendy <a href="http://www.standardhotels.com/los-angeles/">Standard Hotel</a> in downtown LA, after making the mistake of trying to swim a few laps in the rooftop pool (really an extension of the rooftop bar where LA-beautiful people hang out - swimming while inhaling cigarette smoke was probably a wash), I fell back to my usual city wanderings and tried to find a good bookstore. The closest I found was <a href="http://www.metropolisbooksla.com/">Metropolis Books</a>, a nice little indie store with fewer books on the shelf than I have in my home and not open past 6pm, much like the indie bookstore I found in downtown Bend, OR. To me, a proper cultural downtown should have a more impressive bookstore, like Powell&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.powells.com/">City of Books</a> in Portland, OR.</p>

<p>Assuming the Borders Express in Macy&rsquo;s Plaza holds no surprises, I&rsquo;d have to say LA disappoints on that score, although one could argue the huge<a href="http://www.lapl.org/central/"> LA Central Library</a> provides plenty of literary cred. If you go, be sure to visit the exhibits on the second floor.</p>

<p>But my favorite feature is the steps leading into the west entrance (where a Panda Express is conveniently located)</p>

<p>The library isn&rsquo;t open after 6pm, either, so it looks like evening activities in downtown LA evening are split among the high-end cultural events (whatever&rsquo;s playing at the <a href="http://www.laphil.com/">Disney Concert Hall</a> or <a href="http://musiccenter.org/">Music Center</a>) and club-hopping (when the library is closed the <a href="http://librarybarla.com/">Library Bar</a> is open!).</p>

<p>But on my way back through the <a href="http://www.lacity.org/ANGELSWALK/">Historic Core</a>, I found a bit of culture that seemed right at home in LA, the <a href="http://www.neonmona.org/">Museum of Neon Art</a>, which I first saw profiled by <a href="http://kcet.org/">KCET</a>&rsquo;s terrifically loud and entertainingly informative <a href="http://www.calgold.com/">Huell Howser</a>:</p>

<p>Their lease is up, so I hope they have success in finding a new space. Or maybe they could move to Vegas.</p>
