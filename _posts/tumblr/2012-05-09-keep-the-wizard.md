Here’s a Unity tip - don’t disable the wizard. A long time ago, that startup window bugged me and I disabled it, but that inconvenience is nothing compared to getting stuck with a project that won’t load and then trying to remember the key combination that forces Unity to start up with immediately opening the last-opened project. It’s especially important if you’re trying out a new version of Unity and don’t want to automatically upgrade the last-opened project (or if you’re still switching between old and new versions of Unity like I am).

Do this:

And you’ll see this again on every Unity startup. Much safer.
