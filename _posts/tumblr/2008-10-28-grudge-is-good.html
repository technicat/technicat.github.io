<p>Grudges generally get a bad name, from the <a href="http://www.wvculture.org/hiStory/crime/hatfieldmccoy01.html">Hatfield-McCoy feud</a> to the ongoing ethnic and religious battles all over the world (&ldquo;your great-great-whoever oppressed/cheated/exploited/violated my great-great-whoever. Now it&rsquo;s your fault&rdquo;, &ldquo;you heathens have maligned our spiritual principles. Death to you.&rdquo;)</p>

<p>But grudges have their good points. Sports fans, commentators and journalists love a good grudge (&ldquo;This is a grudge match.&rdquo; &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no love lost between these teams&rdquo;), and are positively bored if opposing athletes just have nice things to say about each other, shake hands and go out for beers together. Grudges are great for movie plots, too - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Payback_(film)">Payback</a>, for example, gets right to the point in its title.</p>

<p>An underrated use of grudges is in entrepeneurship. A lot has been made of starting businesses to change the world, fill a need, express ones creativity, all the yada yada you see on the business bookshelves and hear from the guests on Donny Deutch&rsquo;s shows (The Big Idea, Collaboration Now&hellip;), but open the skull of any business owner and there&rsquo;s a good chance you&rsquo;ll find a tape recorder playing back &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll show you&hellip;&rdquo; If corporate vision statements were truthful, most would have the three V&rsquo;s - vengeance, validation, vindication.</p>

<p>Now, while I have no shortage of professional grievances, I&rsquo;m not quite energetic or ambitious enough to turn that into the next object of Wired magazine&rsquo;s hype. I do however find grudges quite useful in saving money, especially in these nervous-finance times. Just last week I walked into a Best Buy on a whim to see the new Apple laptops. Normally, I&rsquo;d have trouble walking out of a store like that without at least picking up a DVD, and Best Buy had a nice selection of reasonably priced Blue-Ray discs. But each one I was interested in was a Warner Brothers title, and I&rsquo;m still annoyed that the WB never sent me a check for a mail-in rebate years ago (the rejection later stated that a rebate had been sent in previously from the same address and they only honored one rebate per address - a problem, since this was an apartment I&rsquo;d just moved into).</p>

<p>So I saved at least $20-$30 right there, but then I passed the Horror section where, in honor of Halloween, several DVD&rsquo;s were priced at $4. I almost scooped up a bunch right there, and then I remembered that very Best Buy six years ago had sold me an expensive Alienware PC, aggressively pushed an extended warranty on me then left me in line for half an hour to pay, and somehow got me signed onto automatic monthly billing from Microsoft&rsquo;s Internet service (even though there was no paperwork indicating I had an account). To top it off, I missed out on the resulting <a href="http://www.tgdaily.com/content/view/31975/118/">lawsuit</a> (though, apparently, it was dismissed and now is back on).</p>

<p>I almost got my money back from Microsoft - I got phone transferred from someone who didn&rsquo;t know what I was talking about to someone in billing who agreed to refund me to someone in customer support who refused to refund me. In the end, my credit card company took care of that payment, but in the meantime, Microsoft charged me another month, and I just gave up. You can&rsquo;t fight city hall? You can&rsquo;t fight Microsoft.</p>

<p>So, while I probably saved another $20 or so before finally leaving the store, I can&rsquo;t apply the same grudge-based savings criteria to Microsoft. I can live without Best Buy. I&rsquo;ll have to live in a cave (or an Apple Store) if I don&rsquo;t buy Microsoft. In fact, for my current contract, I&rsquo;ve had to purchase two PC&rsquo;s in less than two years. That TV ad, where celebrities apparently have been paid off to say &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a PC&rdquo; (I mean, why else would you say it?) - they should include one person saying &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a PC - because I have no choice.&rdquo;</p>
