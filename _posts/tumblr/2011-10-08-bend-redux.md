_Originally written on Epinions in September 2007:_

I found myself this spring with enough Marriott Rewards and airline credit (from the annual travel snafu known as Christmas) to pay a second visit to Bend. As my previous visit had been in winter and at the Ameritel Inn by the Old Mill shopping center, I figured this time it’d be warmer and I’d have an opportunity to explore downtown Bend.

That turned out to be true, but despite the expansive name of the Fairfield Inn and Suites Bend Downtown, it’s a bit of a walk from the hotel to downtown, involving one busy intersection (and, in my case, a heavily tattooed gentleman who welcomed me to America and offered to sell me some weed), and April in Bend isn’t really that warm. Especially in the evening, it cools down fast!

The Fairfield Inn is comparably priced to the Ameritel, not quite as pretty, but clean and modern, and features about the same level of amenities with an indoor pool and jacuzzi. The lobby/lounge has a nice fireplace and wall-mounted flat-screen TV and hosts the complimentary breakfast. Like the Ameritel, the meal is a cut above your average continental breakfast, with premixed cups of waffle batter next to a waffle-maker (is this an Oregonian thing?) and Jimmy Dean sausage sandwiches.

The staff was friendly and courteous, providing me with the toothbrush/toothpaste kit that I usually need, although I thought I detected a little impatience when I left my room keycard in my room for the second time.

Aside from the complimentary internet access (wire, not wireless, but I believe I saw some ethernet jacks in the lounge), there’s not much to do in the hotel. I’m not much of a skiier or outdoorsman, but I found plenty to occupy myself downtown - good restaurants and cafes, a couple of bookstores, and a well-stocked comic book store. What more do you need?
