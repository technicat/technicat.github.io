I’m not crazy about the standard resume format. A chronological list of employers is not that interesting (and sometimes depressing), and anyway, doesn’t work that well if you’re self employed.

One more interesting representation is your programming language narrative (which would also be more interesting than just listing programming languages). In my case, I can safely say I’ve forgotten more languages than many programmers know (and I’m not bragging, it’s actually kind of sad - I hope I don’t have to pick up a Perl book again).

I started programming in the 80’s. In fact, I think it was right in 1980 that I started programming in BASIC on a TRS-80 in my junior high school library. But that wasn’t really programming, it was just repeatedly typing in a magazine listing of a Star Trek game until the librarian suggested I save the program on tape (that’s cassette tape).

I did a little bit better at a summer computer class typing in yet another Star Trek program in BASIC on Commodore computers, making some minor modifications, but it wasn’t until I picked up the user manual for the Apple II in my high school library (I wonder how many programmers from my generation got their start in the school library?) that I saw the light. All of a sudden, I understood programming! I wanted to write a chess program, so I started with an reversi (Othello) game, which was good enough to be my first pirated game (I know because one of my high school friends gave me a disk of pirated games with my game on it).

During high school, I also dabbled in Pascal and 6502 machine language (there’s nothing like programming in machine language to learn exactly what a microprocessor is), but basically those were my BASIC years. And that came to an end when I went to college. I started off slow, there, with just a Fortran course and to tell you the truth, I took that famous MIT 6.001 course but didn’t understand it until I reread the textbook after graduation. So although that course introduced Scheme, it was really through my part-time work at the AI lab that I got to know Lisp, specifically Zetalisp for the Symbolics Lisp Machine. Again, a programmer-friendly machine with a great user manual (affectionaly known as the “Chine Nual” for the way the title Lisp Machine Manual was usually seen on the book). And, as in high school, I wrote a reversi program, a parallel-processing version in multilisp, for my bachelor’s thesis. Again, I originally wanted to write a chess program, but my advisor hinted that wouldn’t be a good way to graduate on time.

So my college years were Lisp years, although my Lisp years extended an additional seven years after graduation, with occasional forays into C and C++, and some fun class work in my masters program with ML. First, it was Lisp on TI Explorer Lisp machines for VLSI CAD tools, then, with Lisp machines on the endangered species list, Lisp on workstations for Hubble telescope scheduling, submarine simulation, military data analysis, and computer graphics.

My last big Lisp project involved porting from Unix workstations to Windows. After that, it was Java on PCs. Java for computer graphics, semiconductor fab scheduling (working for the same guy who did the Hubble scheduling in Lisp), and mobile web browsing. Also, a little bit of Tcl/Tk got in. That lasted until the dot com bust (so not nearly as long as the previous Lisp era).

After that, I somehow went into video games, so it was mostly C and C++, with bits of Lua, smaller bits of Python, and brief experiments with J2ME, and a nicely paying Java contract in the middle (and by nicely paying, I mean not a video game contract).

Technically, that was about a ten year stretch continuing up until a few years ago (my work on Blue Mars involved CryEngine), but I also started using Unity around 2007 (version 1.5), so there’s also been an overlapping stretch of using their JavaScript (some prefer to call it UnityScript), and a recent wholesale conversion to C#. If we broaden the discussion to platforms, you could these recent years have been my Mono years, and the latest development might be F#.

BASIC was fun as my first language, Lisp I liked as a language, Java I liked as a platform, and it’s been all downhill or plateau from there. But F# looks both fun and practical (functional programming with ML roots, but with OO and imperative support and available on Mono), and Xamarin is pushing it for mobile development. It might be enough for me to stop complaining about the lack of Lisp. Maybe I’ll start with that chess program…
