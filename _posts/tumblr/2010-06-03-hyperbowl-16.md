[HyperBowl 1.6](http://itunes.apple.com/app/hyperbowl/id344209253?mt=8) was approved on the App Store today. I was getting a bit worried since I submitted it a week ago, and approvals this year have mostly taken three days or less. But subtracting Memorial Day weekend, I guess this still only took four business days.

In any case, I was a bit anxious to get this update out since the previous release was the first one with native iPad support, and I belatedly realized that if you swiped vigorously on the iPad screen you could exceed the limits of the physics system, i.e. roll the ball at high speeds through a wall. As far as I know, no one’s done that, but in any case, I tweaked the controls to compensate for the larger screen and added a speed limit for the ball.

This release is also the first one featuring High Seas, the fourth HyperBowl lane. It’s defining feature is a rocking ship as the bowling platform, but the physics cost means the lane is not active on the iPhone (I tried playing it at 10fps - not fun). I’ll probably enable for the iPhone in the next update but with the rocking turned off. Won’t be the same, but at least iPhone users will be able to play it.
