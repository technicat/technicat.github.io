<p>When my sister told me I should work on <a href="http://www.apple.com/iphone/">iPhone</a> games, I finally got off my duff and applied to the <a href="//developer.apple.com/iphone/program/">Apple Developer Program</a>. Three months later, I&rsquo;m in. Apparently, there&rsquo;s a longer vetting process if you apply as a company rather than an individual developer, but the timing is not bad - the <a href="http://unity3d.com/unity/features/iphone-publishing">Unity engine for iPhone</a> is due to be released next week, and I&rsquo;ve got a pipeline of projects ready to go.</p>

<p>To celebrate, I threw out several years worth of mobile phone development documentation.  <a href="http://java.sun.com/javame/index.jsp">J2ME </a>programming is mostly straightforward, except everyone has their own SDK, always on Windows, never on the Mac, even though the Mac is a fine Java development environment (I ended up building all my J2ME apps on my Mac with <a href="http://mpowerplayer.com/">mpowerplayer</a>, also using it to showcase the resulting midlets on the web, as with the <a href="http://www.fugugames.com/mobilegames.html">Digimana games</a>). Testing on a local device doesn&rsquo;t require a program membership and accompaning $99 fee (or $199 for corporate deployment) as in the iPhone program&hellip;if you can find a cable. Of the two phones I used for J2ME testing, I found one data cable in a T-mobile store, and for the other I drove to a specialty store in Irvine, where the proprietor scavenged a cable from a similar model.</p>

<p>But the biggest problem with J2ME was the publishing. I started with a Nextel <a href="http://www.arcx.com/sites/Motorolai85.htm">Motorola i85s</a> that disconcertingly invoked a static noise from any nearby speaker that had MIDP 1.0 and just enough memory and display for simple black-and-white games, and the Motorola-run <a href="http://idenphones.motorola.com/iden/">IDEN</a> network for publishing apps. A J2ME programmer at the <a href="http://ocjug.org/">Orange County Java Users group</a> informed me that Motorola wasn&rsquo;t all that interested in games, but I wasn&rsquo;t all that interested in paying the thousand-dollar or so submission fee, either. (that $99 for Apple doesn&rsquo;t sound so bad, anymore!)</p>

<p>So after testing my usual Othello program on the phone, with just enough room left over for a calculator program, I left it alone until I switched to T-Mobile and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sony_Ericsson_T610">Sony-Ericsson T610</a>, advertised to include MIDP 2.0, a color display, and downloadable games via  t-zones. I saw t-zones, saw no way to download games, returned to the T-Mobile store to watch the sales reps fiddle with my phone and conclude &ldquo;yeah, there&rsquo;s no way to download games on this model&rdquo;.</p>

<p>In the meantime, I saw J2ME pre-installed on the slick <a href="http://www.palm.com/us/support/palm5/">Palm V</a>&rsquo;s (the last good-looking Palm) sold at a special price during Java One (where a Sun employee asked to cut in front of me to get around the daily quota) and then watched Palm decline as part of 3com, watched <a href="http://handango.com/">Handango</a> announce a publishing program for J2ME apps then abandon it (at least for phones - they seem to support Palm and Rim), finally upgrade from my otherwise excellent T610 to a <a href="http://www.blackberry.com/blackberrypearl/">Blackberry Pearl</a> to find that no only did the syncing not run on my Mac, it didn&rsquo;t run on Vista. And I kept rationalizing, there&rsquo;s a glut of 2D phone games (it seems to me there&rsquo;s one perfect 2D cell phone game - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudoku">Sudoku</a>) - so I&rsquo;ll wait for 3D on cell phones. But mophun is gone, I don&rsquo;t know what happened to Superscape, I&rsquo;ve seen one <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_3D_Graphics_API">M3G</a> phone, which I think cost a friend of mine $300, and I only heard of <a href="http://www.khronos.org/opengles/">OpenGL ES</a> running on one or a few Nokia phones that I&rsquo;ve never seen in a store.</p>

<p>But now there&rsquo;s the iPhone (or iTouch), which actually does have OpenGL ES. And I can develop on my Mac. Using the same development tools used for <a href="http://www.fugugames.com/">my desktop and web games</a>. And self-publish (given Apple approval) on the <a href="http://www.apple.com/iphone/appstore/">App Store</a>. Yep, that&rsquo;s how I planned it all along!</p>
