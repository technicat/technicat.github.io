While morbidly googling for old employers (I’m afraid I’ve left a trail of moribund companies in my wake), I ran across this [jobs salary site](http://jobs-salary.com/). Better than using salary surveys, these are real salary records obtained from the Department of Labor. I found my last employer (oh, so many years ago) was as cheap as I thought, but here’s how the other half lives - some snippets, from Goldman Sachs, and Google (maybe I should try applying again).
