<p>These modern coworking spaces with the emphasis on making everyone visible and audible strike me as emanating from the minds of ad industry types. I&rsquo;m not making this up - I&rsquo;ve interviewed at an ad place and that&rsquo;s what it&rsquo;s like. Another clue: all the coffee table books are about logos, infographics, record covers&hellip;but look at the work desks and you can see what people really need to read are books on Drupal and Javascript (Once again, I miss the tech culture of BBN - the last place I worked at that had a really good library).</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not just complaining about this shiny office because I walked into the glass wall of a meeting room (&ldquo;Oh, beer!&rdquo; I said, spying the keg inside. My Homer Simpson moment). But I have to admit, they know their interior design and they do some stuff right. This newly-opened lobby is the best one I&rsquo;ve seen in an office building - big sofas, nice artwork, garage door opening to the street (I think the locals are figuring it&rsquo;s a nicer place to hang out than the Starbucks down the street). In fact, I&rsquo;m using it as my real office - my desk is just a charging station. And I&rsquo;m getting better at the pinball machine.</p>
