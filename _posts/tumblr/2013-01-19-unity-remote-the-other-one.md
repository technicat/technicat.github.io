Over the holidays, I was startled to see a box titled Unity Remote on the Apple Store shelves. Turns out it’s a bluetooth doohickey that turns an iOS device into a universal remote. I showed enough interest in it that my sister got it for me as a Christmas present. It’s got some rough edges - I’ve had to reestablish the bluetooth connection in Settings several times, and I have some quibbles with the user interface. Also, my TV went blank, apparently permanently, while I was trying it out, but I switched to backup monitor and it seems fine since, so chalk up the hardware failure to age and coincidence. It works well enough that I’ve lost my remote again, and so far I haven’t had to look for it.
