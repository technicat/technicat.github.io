Over the past year, I experimented with temporarily making some apps free to spur sales or drive traffic to other paying apps. I’d have to say it was a failure - not only did I not detect any increased revenue, I got lower ratings (typically dropping the average by a star) and more negative reviews. I imagine once you make an app free, you’re dropping it into a market of users who don’t generally pay for apps and don’t factor price into their evaluation (in other words, they’re spoiled - I saw one reviewer complain that the developer was “unethical” in charging for an app that was once free).

I have seen stories of price drops used successfully, and I can see that repeatedly dropping then raising prices will generate visibility on sites that track such things, so I’m probably not doing this right. But I just realized another downside of this tactic - the only two of my apps that I’ve seen cracked are the two apps I temporarily made free. So I guess my categorization of the market is only half right - there is a group of users who don’t pay for apps, but they are price-conscious enough to crack paid apps if they can get their hands on them without paying. (I’m thinking of making all my free apps temporarily non-free to keep them busy) In fact, the listings for these cracked apps include the App Store price - like, “see what you’re saving!” It doesn’t seem like an altruistic endeavor to me - the sites host ads and, cheekily enough, ask for donations. How about sending some of that my way?
