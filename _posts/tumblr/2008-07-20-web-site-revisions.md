I’ve been meaning to remark on a couple of web sites, but the oddities I saw a few weeks ago are gone:

- [LegalZoom](http://www.legalzoom.com/) - I visited this site for low-cost legal services after repeatedly seeing ads on CNBC featuring founder [Robert Shapiro](http://robertshapiro.com/), of [O.J. trial](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O._J._Simpson_murder_case) fame. Strangely, the site had a page of endorsements solely from Fox News talk show hosts (does Bill O'Reilly really need cheap legal advice?). That page is entirely gone, now.
- [MoveOn](http://moveon.org/) - I vaguely recall seeing somewhat obnoxious political ads from them in past elections and indignant Republican responses (but nothing lately, are they getting less attention?), but only recently visited their web site. The top campaign asked visitors to express their outrage at [Wesley Clark’s comment](http://mediamatters.org/items/200807010001) about McCain being taken out of context. Right below that, a list of Top Ten Things You Should Know About McCain, with a bunch of snippets taken out of context (what did you expect, top ten expansive essays?) Stuff like, did you know John McCain is one of the richest members of Congress? (Who cares? What’s the cutoff - Clinton-rich is OK, but McCain rich is too rich?) Top ten lists are great for talk-show comedy bits and, well, blogs (try googling “McCain top ten”), but not so great for political discourse. The list is still there, but the Clark campaign is now gone - can’t even find it in their campaign archives.
This leads me to a few conclusions:
1. When I see something that looks ridiculous on a web site, it seems I’m not the only one.
2. If I want to blog about it, I’ve gotta move faster.
3. There’s plenty of regular revision work out there for web designers.
