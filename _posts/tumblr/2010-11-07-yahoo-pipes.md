I haven’t had much use for Yahoo. I had an account to participate in a Yahoo group several years ago, but when I changed my email address to avoid spam, the process of getting back into my account was somehow too mystifying. I don’t even remember that username, anymore.

But I wanted to try the instructions from [AppMakr](http://appmakr.com/) on using [Yahoo Pipes](http://pipes.yahoo.com/) to process Facebook RSS feeds, so I created a new account (it actually granted me one of my requested usernames without qualifying numbers or punctuation marks - that’s a good start!) and created my Pipe. It’s pretty cool! Anytime you can just drag, drop and connect in a browser just makes the web more fun. Yahoo!
