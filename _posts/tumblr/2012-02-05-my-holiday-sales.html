<p>The checks are in, and I can safely say December has been my best month of self-employment income, totalling around $2000, not counting contract work. This is what showed up in my bank accounts in the last 30 days:
</p><ul><li>App Store - $1301.79, about 1/3 from sales and the rest from Â iAds</li>
	<li>Android Market - $11.02 in sales</li>
	<li>Barnes and Noble Nook - $152.48 in sales</li>
	<li>Amazon Appstore - $263.58 in sales (I already spent much of this on a Kindle Fire)</li>
	<li>AdMob - $37.53 (from Android Market, Amazon Appstore, maybe Handster and, um, unauthorized sites)</li>
	<li>Ubinuri - $290 (Korean appstore)</li>
	<li>Unity Asset Store - $14 (I sell about one copy of the Fugu Maze project a month)</li>
</ul>
I can already tell there&rsquo;s a dropoff on the App Store and Amazon Appstore since then - the rest are pretty steady, Nook sales might even be increasing (the Nook Tablet probably helps), and I know AdMob picked up a bit with some recent app updates. So, back to work!
