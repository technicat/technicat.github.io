The checks are in, and I can safely say December has been my best month of self-employment income, totalling around $2000, not counting contract work. This is what showed up in my bank accounts in the last 30 days:

- App Store - $1301.79, about 1/3 from sales and the rest from &nbsp;iAds
- Android Market - $11.02 in sales
- Barnes and Noble Nook - $152.48 in sales
- Amazon Appstore - $263.58 in sales (I already spent much of this on a Kindle Fire)
- AdMob - $37.53 (from Android Market, Amazon Appstore, maybe Handster and, um, unauthorized sites)
- Ubinuri - $290 (Korean appstore)
- Unity Asset Store - $14 (I sell about one copy of the Fugu Maze project a month)
I can already tell thereâ€™s a dropoff on the App Store and Amazon Appstore since then - the rest are pretty steady, Nook sales might even be increasing (the Nook Tablet probably helps), and I know AdMob picked up a bit with some recent app updates. So, back to work!
