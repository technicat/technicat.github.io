<p>This might sound lame, but I&rsquo;m still updating apps to Unity 4. I just caught up with <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/fugu-maze/id295808255">Fugu Maze</a> and <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/fugu-maze-free/id455596850">Fugu Maze Free</a>, which haven&rsquo;t been updated since September. Part of the reason was, well, Unity 4, and then all of the middleware that I&rsquo;ve piled on. There was a minor change in the Prime31 Etcetera plugin, which I use for the camera access, and EZGUI was giving me compile errors for a while. And it&rsquo;s possible there was an Apple rejection in there somewhere, but I&rsquo;ve found if you wait long enough, no one remembers why it was rejected.</p>

<p>And then there&rsquo;s the matter of supporting the iPhone 5, which only requires uploading a screenshot. But I only remember that after submitting the app and immediately getting the we&rsquo;re-waiting-for-that-screenshot email. I always take the least-correct and fastest approach - stretching the screenshot from my iPod touch. You can barely tell, the icon at the bottom is slightly squashed. Otherwise, I think it looks pretty nice, even though I&rsquo;m just using vertex lighting (I should crank it up for the newer devices).</p>
