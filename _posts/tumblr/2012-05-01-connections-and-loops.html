<p>In high school, I loved class sessions where they just showed a film, and my favorite show was Connections, each episode of which showed how we got from there to here, where there was some odd thing that happened a long, long time ago. I thought of that again when I read Malcolm Gladwell&rsquo;s Outliers and its theme of being in the right place at the right time.</p>

<p>I think Gladwell is on to something there, whereas fortunately placed individuals in Bill Gates&rsquo; generation ended up with, well, Gatesian success, while from my class at MIT, I can&rsquo;t think of anyone who attained anywhere near such heights (closest would be John Maeda, favorite of Wired magazine and now president of the Rhode Island School of Design).</p>

<p>Still, it&rsquo;s interesting to ponder how one thing led to another. For example, if my family hadn&rsquo;t moved from California to Iowa just before I entered high school, my chances of getting into MIT would have been a lot lower. My SAT scores were around MIT average, with math a bit lower and verbal a bit higher, and I know people who had similar scores and were wait-listed - the difference between us was that they were from states like California and New York and Massachusetts were several hundred applied and a few hundred were accepted. Meanwhile, we had a handful from Iowa, and the only applicant I know of from my high school class who didn&rsquo;t get accepted didn&rsquo;t send his application in on time.</p>

<p>The California-to-Iowa move took place in the middle of the school year, so I had a lot of study hall, which meant the discovery of an Apple II sitting in the school library. In California, my school friends urged me to check out the computer, a TRS-80, and my first question was &ldquo;what can you do with a computer?&rdquo; And I didn&rsquo;t really figure that out - I got as far as repeatedly typing in a BASIC program from a magazine (until the librarian mentioned that I could save programs on a cassette deck) but didn&rsquo;t quite get the concept of programming. However, when I sat down and read the Applesoft programming manual, and typed in some simple BASIC programs that drew bar charts, I saw the light. And shortly after that, my Dad purchased an Apple II, and I started programming away (he also got a printer after seeing me actually type out my code listings on a typewriter!)</p>

<p>Fast forward to senior year, and I think the determining factor that sent me to MIT was my senior photograph. I probably would have gone to Stanford if they&rsquo;d accepted me, but they were the only school to wait-list me, and they were one of the two schools that asked for a photograph, and mine was the standard drivers license quality photo the school supplied, featuring a nerdy Asian kid with the flash reflecting off his glasses. The application form said it would have no effect on the admissions process, but who&rsquo;s kidding who. The other school that asked for a photo was Caltech (maybe it&rsquo;s a California thing), but I&rsquo;m guessing it&rsquo;s less of a beauty contest there (their recruiter enthusiastically said I could join their soccer team, newspaper&hellip;it sounded like I could be BMOC).</p>

<p>So, too proud to wait on a wait list, I went to MIT (Caltech had a ten-to-one male-female ratio - MIT&rsquo;s four-to-one ratio sounded like a spring break fest in comparison). In my first week, while touring dorms during rush week, I became friends with someone who&rsquo;s eventual roommate turned into a good friend of mine, who in turn was friends with the aforementioned John Maeda, who, four years later, when it looked questionable whether I&rsquo;d get a job, passed my resume on to his group at Texas Instruments, where it was sent on to the rest of the company and eventually made it back to that group, whereupon they called me in for an interview and the boss told me I didn&rsquo;t have &ldquo;walk on water&rdquo; grades (he was being kind, or ironic), then I got hired anyway when he was out of town. And when I couldn&rsquo;t stand that job anymore a year later, John Maeda again got me a job, back at MIT, taking his place as a programmer in a research project. Then he went to Japan, studied graphic design, and became famous.</p>

<p>Anyway, back to me, another result of going to MIT was becoming a Lisp programmer. Not the way I was supposed to, through the introductory 6.001 Scheme course which I only appreciated after rereading the text after I graduated. Instead, because I was only looking for paying work as part time jobs (same policy I have today), I eschewed the hot campus-wide Project Athena which would have given me a strong start in Unix and C (not to mention stuff they invented like kerberos), and after some stints in word processing, PC administration and Mac sales, I somehow got work in the MIT AI lab programming on Symbolics Lisp Machines, first with 3D graphics for the vision group and later graphical interfaces for natural language processing. And I did my bachelor&rsquo;s thesis on Multilisp, using it to implement a parallel (and still badly-playing) version of reversi.</p>

<p>All that Lisp was also a factor that led to my job at Texas Instruments, since that involved programming on TI Explorer Lisp Machines. And was a factor in my next job at MIT (software started in Lisp, ported to C), then at the Space Telescope Science Institute (telescope scheduling), then a summer job at NASA Ames (interface for an AI planner), then at the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Lab (rule-based submarine simulation), then BBN (data analysis), and finally, seeing people move west to join Netscape and get rich, I moved to LA and joined a company called Nichimen Graphics which was actually descended from the Symbolics Graphics group (at this point, the original Symbolics was now just a web site). And so in seven years, I closed the loop and ended where I began, programming 3D in Lisp.</p>

<p>A new thread started from there, though. After Nichimen, I joined a startup with another ex-Nichimen colleague who wanted to work with Java. From there, again lured by the siren call of Silicon Valley, I moved to a Java job in the Bay Area working for my old boss from Space Telescope (and where, at company party, I failed to chat up a certain Sergey Brin and Larry Page before they received their first round of financing - oh, well, that&rsquo;s one possible career thread that never happened). After that, it was a short hop to San Francisco where I got interested in working on consumer-oriented mobile devices (blackberries). And then we reconnect with the Nichimen thread as another colleague from there got me into an LA startup as the dot com boom was starting to bust. At that point, many of my Nichimen colleagues had moved into games - another one got me a stint at Hyper Entertainment, where I worked on HyperBowl.</p>

<p>My second game job was random. Really, the company owner found me at GDC. That project gave me some console experience and a desire not to have a regular job again, plus there was that pesky dot-com bust job recession, so I went freelance and started getting work from my Nichimen connections. Easily six of my last eight contracts were from those connections. Another loop closing, when I started working on my own games, I contacted my old employers at Hyper and asked for a license to develop HyperBowl for platforms like the iPhone and they kindly granted me one. And that&rsquo;s been my premiere app that I&rsquo;ve been working on the last three years (revenue-wise and effort-wise). And here&rsquo;s the big loop closing, I&rsquo;m back programming on Apple! If I was doing it in Lisp, it would be perfect.</p>
