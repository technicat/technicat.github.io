A while ago I complained to Time-Warner about a salesman coming to my door in the evening trying to get me to buy their TV and phone package,&nbsp; and otherwise just irritating the hell out of me. I guess my complaint wasnâ€™t specific enough - last night they called me on my cell phone instead, again pushing their TV and phone package. Ironically, a big reason I got rid of my home phone was to avoid telemarketing calls.
