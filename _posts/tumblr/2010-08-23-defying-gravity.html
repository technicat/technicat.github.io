<p>Despite its pitch as &ldquo;Gray&rsquo;s Anatomy in Space&rdquo;, I started watching episodes of Defying Gravity on the PlayStation Store. (I was looking for Dollhouse, but oddly, that&rsquo;s listed under Crime instead of Sci-Fi). Defying Gravity is not bad - I like the characters and story arc, could do without the cutesy music, yes, reminiscent of Gray&rsquo;s Anatomy. But it&rsquo;s no Firefly. So it&rsquo;s fitting that when I searched for &ldquo;defying gravity&rdquo; on YouTube, I found this homage to Firefly.</p>
