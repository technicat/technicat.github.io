Yesterday was a day of a couple of firsts. First first, it was my first time trying out Zipcar (although not the first time I reserved a Zipcar - I cancelled that one). Also my first time driving a Prius.

I was surprised to see only Priuses (Prii?) in the nearby Caltrain parking lot, but it makes sense. Zipcar pays for the gas, and even then, it’s the driver’s responsibility to keep at least a quarter tank full which can be a hassle, so electric is a win-win (I’m looking forward to the Zipcar Tesla)

The Prius is not as fun to drive as my ‘94 Celica (I miss you, baby…), but it does drive just fine and is really easy to drive. And the dashboard is both well-designed and fascinating, telling you when the battery is discharging and charging and when you’re sucking up gas.

I was also pleasantly surprised to see that everything I own fits in the Prius. Next time I move, maybe I’ll hit the road in a Prius, Beverly Hillbillies style.
