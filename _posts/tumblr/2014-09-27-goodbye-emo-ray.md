Another virtual world bites the dust. It appears Playstation Home will be shutting down. Too bad, but not unexpected - I know Playstation owners who don’t even know they have Home on their systems. Home is one of two virtual worlds I’ve worked on (in?) during the phase where many attempted to create the second Second Life (the other one I worked on/in is Blue Mars - still running as far as I know).

I contributed to the development of two games within Home, an RC Rally game and a bloody teddy-bear shooting game called Emo-Ray. Thing thing about virtual worlds (and server-based games in general), when it’s gone, it’s gone. All that remain are the YouTube videos.
