I was comparing app store results recently with a fellow mobile game developer and I was surprised to find how different are experiences are. Which means this summary may not apply to you at all. But anyway…

By far, my main breadwinners is the iOS App Store. After three years, I’m closing in on 300,000 downloads, and it provides over 70% of my app income, mostly in iAd revenue (but early this year it was mostly in sales - just goes to show things change quickly and you need to be nimble and flexible). It seems to me the key to sustaining momentum there is to keep cranking out updates. That’s worked out better for me than advertising, press releases, promo codes…

My second best earner is Barnes and Noble. I didn’t sign up with them until a few months ago, and they don’t allow apps with ads on the NOOK Color and tablet, but on the other hand there’s less competition on the B&N app store. Unfortunately, I don’t know how to market there, and app updates don’t seem to produce any bumps in sales, so looks like I need to keep converting new apps for them. On some attempts, I’ve had trouble getting a good frame rate on the NOOK Color, but now that the Tablet is out, maybe I’ll just target that.

Number three is the Android Market - mostly on AdMob revenue from around 30,000 downloads. My AdMob payments don’t compare well to iAd, though. And app sales? Forget about it.

That’s where the Amazon appstore is coming in suprisingly strong. In my first month with them, looks like I’ve got more paid HyperBowl sales than I’ve had on the Android Market in six months. I’m still waiting for the payment, though - I’ll feel better when I see that. And then maybe I’ll buy a Kindle Fire and try to figure out why my apps don’t work on it.

Payment could be an issue with handster. They sent me an email recently asking me to add paid apps to my account. An account which I didn’t know I had, but apparently they had created one for me earlier this year and ran some automated import for all my free apps which basically cut-and-pasted the info from the Android Market. So, OK, six months late I’ve fixed up some of the app descriptions and updated the apk’s, and I added the paid version of HyperBowl (Pro), but they have a $200 minimum payout, so that could get annoying. But they have been acquired by Opera, which has apparently ditched appia as their store backend (appia, formerly handango, yet another store with some screwy Amazon-like terms, but what the heck, you never know what’s going to work out for you…)

And currently on hold, I’m waiting for South Korean government approval before HyperBowl shows up on ubinuri’s appstore, and I uploaded HyperBowl to AndroidTap’s new appstore (like B&N a paid-only appstore), but their developer dashboard doesn’t actually yet show apps you’ve submitted. I think that one’s going to take a while.
