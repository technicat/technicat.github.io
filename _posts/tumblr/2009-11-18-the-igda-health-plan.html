<p>As the year is approaching it&rsquo;s end (once again, way too fast!), I&rsquo;ve been wondering whether I should continue my studio membership in the IGDA. I originally joined to show support for the excellent industry white papers (mobile games, casual games, online games&hellip;) and the generous help given on the IGDA forums and in the columns (particularly Jim Charne&rsquo;s articles). But I stopped watching the forums largely because it wasn&rsquo;t convenient (no RSS feed), and it seemed like the same questions (or trolling) over and over, I haven&rsquo;t seen any new white papers lately, and recent offerings seem to cater to studio heads with travel budgets rather than the rank and file. Those are just quibbles though - the most recent game credit controversies seemed to end in a whimper, the fracas over Tim Langdell stank from all angles (who were those anonymous concerned citizens?) and the departure of some long-standing board members was more disquieting. And what&rsquo;s up with that newsletter?</p>

<p>But I was very pleasantly surprised (very surprised, very pleased) to see the announcement of an <a href="http://www.igda.org/board-blog/igda-starts-healthcare-program">IGDA group health plan</a>. This is one of those things that I&rsquo;ve been carping about but never expected to see. It is one of those features that professional organizations like the IEEE offer, so not only does it provide a service sorely needed by rank and file game developers who are subject to the whims of employers and unemployment or live in the freelance ecosystem, it helps provide an identity for the IGDA as a professional organization, not just an ain&rsquo;t-it-cool club. To follow the IEEE example further, it&rsquo;d be great to offer a professional liability insurance plan. And a legal plan (like my credit union offers, although I doubt they&rsquo;ll negotiate game contracts for me). But for now, looks like the IGDA has gotten farther than Congress on offering health care. Now, I guess I&rsquo;ll check in on those forums&hellip;</p>
