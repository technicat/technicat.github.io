After rating a couple of [Whedonverse](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffyverse) books on [Goodreads](http://www.goodreads.com/), the [publisher](http://www.smartpopbooks.com/) asked to be my Goodreads “friend”. A crass Myspace-like practice - the [SmartPop profile](http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1046473) lists all their own books and gives top five stars. To top it off, I just found in my Goodreads inbox a note from them inviting me to read their other offerings. Fortunately, Goodreads makes it easy to block a member and flag its messages.

For a publisher of cool, esoteric books, they have pretty lame marketing. I’d already planned to read their books - now I’m inclined to avoid them.
