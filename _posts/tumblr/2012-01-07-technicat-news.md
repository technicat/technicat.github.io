I’m playing around with paper.li again. I tried it a year ago, but it stopped updating after four days and I forgot about it. This time I have [Technicat News](http://paper.li/fugugames) set to auto-tweet, so we’ll see how that goes, and I’ve included included it in all my [Facebook pages](http://facebook.com/technicatllc) using their Facebook app. Their small web widget is too animated for my taste include in my web site sidebars, though, and the big one is too big, and doesn’t show up in this blog, but here’s a screenshot:

I’ll see how the updates look and try tweaking the feeds (I don’t see manual curating in my future).
