<p>For once, I received a <a href="http://www.paypal.com/">Paypal</a> email that was good news and not fraudulent - I registered my first sale of  <a href="http://www.apple.com/downloads/dashboard/games/fugutype.html">FuguType</a>, one of my MacOSX widgets using the <a href="http://www.unity3d.com/">Unity</a> web player for $.99 to a woman in Texas.</p>

<p><!--more-->Like my other widgets, FuguType is a little gameplay experiment - some would categorize it as a &ldquo;toy&rdquo; rather than a full-fledged game. While trying out Unity, I thought the water looked pretty good, and I envisioned creating something like Camcom&rsquo;s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1942_(video_game)">1942</a> vertical scrolling arcade game. I also wanted to make a game that relied on typing, rationalizing that I should take advantage of platform-specific features, e.g. the keyboard. Marry, the two, and you&rsquo;ve got vertically scrolling words that you have to type to shoot down.</p>

<p>It doesn&rsquo;t feel like the structure is complete. Currently, the word-length will increase as your typing accuracy improves and decrease as you fall off, but it could use a flashier scoring indicator and splash effects, at least a splash sound. There should also be some break in the action - a &ldquo;boss&rdquo;, perhaps in the form of a sentence (&ldquo;a quick brown fox&hellip;&rdquo;) and succession to next stages, if the analog to the arcade game is maintained.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve learned some things about selling Mac widgets, too. The <a href="http://www.apple.com/downloads/macosx/">Apple download site</a> provides great exposure with minimal marketing effort on my part. Most widgets are free, so after perhaps 200,000 widget downloads, I&rsquo;ve registered four or five sales. At $.99 per widget (I&rsquo;m borrowing the <a href="http://www.apple.com/itunes/">ITunes</a> model), those who do bother to pay don&rsquo;t have any qualms about it - at least two of my my customers paid for the widgets without downloading and trying them out, first (possibly they didn&rsquo;t realize that was an option). And since I&rsquo;ve responded to two customer support emails, at $.99 per sale, you better make sure it&rsquo;s obvious how to use them.</p>
