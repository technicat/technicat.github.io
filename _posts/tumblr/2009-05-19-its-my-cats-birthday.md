My cat received a nice [birthday ecard](http://www.sloppykisscards.com/partnerfetch.php?partnerid=vetinsite&partnerAffiliateId=709&cardId=xsp5qhr2c9) today from her vet.

Which makes me wonder 1) is my cat more popular than me? and 2) if the next frontier of Web 2.0 is for pets. (Web 2.5?) A google search turned up quite a few - I donâ€™t know how good they are, but there are some snappy names:

[PetZume](http://petzume.com/)

[CuteAsHell](http://cuteashell.com/)

[PetCrash](http://petcrash.com/)

[MyPetFriends](http://mypetfriends.biz/)

[PetFiles](http://pet-files.com/)

[YouPet](http://youpet.com/)
