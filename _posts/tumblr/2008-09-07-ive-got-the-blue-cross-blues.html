<p>After years of complaining about how much I hate <a href="http://www.healthnet.com/">Healthnet</a>, I switched to <a href="http://www.anthem.com/">Anthem Blue Cross</a> policy that featured compatibility with a <a href="http://www.ustreas.gov/offices/public-affairs/hsa/">Health Savings Account</a>. At first I wasn&rsquo;t impressed by the HSA - it&rsquo;s basically an <a href="http://www.aarp.org/money/financial_planning/sessionseven/individual_retirement_accounts.html">IRA</a> that you can use to fund current health care expenses, but it requires a high-deductible policy, there&rsquo;s a monthly management fee, the maximum contribution is much lower than an IRA, and the allowable medical expenses are limited, e.g. you can&rsquo;t use it to pay your health care premiums. Still, it should save a few hundred in taxes a year and it can accumulate into a wad of tax-free cash when you hit 65.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not sure Anthem Blue Cross is going to be much of an improvement over Healthnet. I thought I&rsquo;d applied for coverage starting 8/1 but instead I got a policy starting 7/15, which meant overlapping policies for half a month (Healthnet won&rsquo;t let you cancel before the end of the month). But that might have been my mistake when I stopped and restarted the application on ehealthinsurance. More annoying, Anthem Blue Cross immediately raised my premium by 25% because of my Crestor prescription. If they&rsquo;re going to cash my first month&rsquo;s premium deposit they should tell me beforehand I&rsquo;m getting a more expensive policy than I applied for, and they should at least document that policy on their premium listings. And their bills include a $2 &ldquo;administrative fee&rdquo;. What&rsquo;s this nickel-and-diming? Combine that with the fact that they switched me to a lower cost cholesterol medicine that somehow costs me $30 more, the cost difference between my old policy and new one is getting smaller and smaller. I should have applied to <a href="http://blueshieldca.com/">Blue Shield</a> - I&rsquo;ve had better experiences with them and only went with Anthem because of the supposedly lower premium.</p>

<p>A portent of things to come: the most recent bill included a page informing policyholders that health insurance isn&rsquo;t like auto insurance - your premium doesn&rsquo;t go up with each claim. Rather, your premium is dictated by your age and demographic. Apparently, that&rsquo;s supposed to be a good thing. (&ldquo;Complain to your auto mechanic&rdquo;, the pamphlet cheerfully advises) But while my auto insurance premiums decreased in the last six years, at Healthnet, where I never exceeded my $1000 deductible, my premium increased every year, quadrupling in six years. I can&rsquo;t think of anything else that has gone up so fast - not gas, not home prices (even at the peak), certainly not my income. What would have been my premium in another ten years? I&rsquo;d do the calculations, but I&rsquo;m getting old and feeble&hellip;</p>
