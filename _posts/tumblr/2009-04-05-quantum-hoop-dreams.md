I retired from amateur basketball after a pickup game with some grade school children who stopped playing at some point to ask me if I was OK (“don’t mind the wheezing, kids”) and then proceeded to give me pointers on my shot.

But I’m still a fan, and maybe out of loyalty to my NCAA Division III alma mater MIT (although the football team was in the regional club league until their biggest player got his PhD), or fond memories of basketball afternoons with engineering coworkers, or just the concept of nerds playing basketball, I was mesmerized by the documentary [Quantum Hoops](http://quantumhoops.com/), which followed the 2006 Caltech basketball team and their irrepressible coach who&nbsp; kept them motivated through 60-point losses and got them to play as hard as they studied (how many can say the reverse at schools with athletic scholarships?). Their season finale overtime game against a “regular” school is as inspirational a sports moment as any. And for the first time since watching my 145lb dorm-mate play linebacker two decades ago, I was able to cheer “Go, Beavers!”.
