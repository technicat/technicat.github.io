I was underwhelmed by last night’s SNL pre-election “bash”, partly because it was mostly a best-of compilation of SNL presidential skits, but also because Sarah Palin’s skit where she half-jokingly threatened the show and network with her upcoming vice-presidential powers came off as creepy. Maybe it was the writing, but I think it was the delivery.

She wasn’t that funny in her first appearance on SNL, either. The hype over her, and Tina Fey’s hysterical impression, has eclipsed John McCain’s genuinely engaging humor, which was on display on Saturday.

I’ve read both McCain’s and Obama’s books (The Faith of our Fathers, The Audacity of Hope). Obama is the better writer, but I found McCain’s story more compelling. During the primaries, the only candidate in either party I found repellent was Tom Tancredo, but on the Republican side I was hoping for McCain and the Democratic side Bill Richardson. At that point, I was thinking if it was between McCain and Clinton, I’d go with McCain. When it turned out to be Obama vs. McCain, I was ambivalent. I was impressed by the early endorsements of Richardson and Edwards. On the other hand, a lot of people seem to like McCain better, including the Clintons and Joe Lieberman. I’m no Hillary fan, and I thought the charges of sexism brought by her supporters against the Obama campaign were exaggerated, if not baseless, but Obama’s “You’re likable enough” comment to her during a debate showed he could be snide.

And while Obama’s speeches are great, I’m not so sure about his legislative record. McCain has mentioned Obama’s abstentions, but apparently that’s a snoozer of an issue compared to Wright/Ayres/socialism, and McCain could harp on how Obama cooperated on the McCain-Kennedy immigration reform only to tack on a union-appeasing amendment later before the bill tanked. But no one wants to sound sympathetic to illegal immigrants these days.

So I figured, let’s wait and see who they pick for their VP slots, and see if it makes the decision easier. And it did. I might have voted for Biden when he was running for the top position years ago, but I can’t imagine every voting Palin for president, even though there’s already talk about Palin 2012.

So, basically, I’m with John Stewart, who said on the Daily Show that he would have voted for McCain against Gore in 2000, but not the McCain campaigning this year. I’ve heard some other persuasive arguments and endorsements, like that from Fareed Zakaria on his GPS show, but the most compelling I’ve seen is from Colin Powell:

Although to be fair, Powell was also the one who convinced me we should invade Iraq.

However it turns out, I think it’s gotta be an improvement over the last eight years, and I’d like to thank both candidates for making one of the more exciting elections.
