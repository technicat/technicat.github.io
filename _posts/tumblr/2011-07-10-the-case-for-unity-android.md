I’ve been using Unity Android for a bit over two months now, and while it’s not clear when I’m going to make that money back, I think it’s the right choice. Basically, I feel if have Unity iOS, you need Unity Android (and I hope whenever I have to pay for Unity iOS and Unity Android again, assuming I’m still in that business, there will be bundle deal if you buy both of them).

Definitely there are challenges with Android. It’s harder to make money. In particular, it’s harder to get people to pay for apps. I’m not even sure exactly where to try marketing my apps. Combine that with the variety of Android devices and OS versions out there, and I’m not even pretending to try to test it on more than my own phone. So brace yourself for the one-star reviews. Google doesn’t discourage people from copying free apps and posting them on other sites, which complicates device filtering and tracking download stats. The device filter doesn’t let you discriminate among OS versions, either.

However, on the Android Market you can self-publish, and you can self-publish immediately and often, whereas getting a new build on the App Store can take anywhere from three days to three months. Or never. I have some apps that I don’t update on the App Store, anymore, because I know Apple will reject them, and I’ve had some new apps that were rejected for reasons like “largely promotional”. I see plenty of apps that fall in that category, like ones that just list other apps, so that grates. I can’t experiment with a free vs. paid version of the same app because Apple is deprecating that now. And Apple doesn’t have a “concept approval” process like the traditional console makers, so this point, I’m loath to embark on a significant new iOS-only project.

But since I’m using cross-platform middleware, specifically Unity, I can deploy new apps on Android, and then iOS. If Apple rejects it, that’s OK, I still have the Android version. I can release a free version on the Android Market, and then if it turns out to be popular, introduce a paid version. I can use in-app purchasing, but it’s nice not to be forced to use it and then worry about some patent troll suing me. I can release updates on the Android Market and then fix any bugs within my control immediately as they popup, and then when a version appears to be stable, release the same one on iOS - whereas if I release an update on iOS first then discover a problem, I have to suffer a blast of user complaints until I get the next version approved.

And the Android universe is expanding. There is an increasing number of app stores for Android. One carrier-operated app store recently asked me to submit my apps, and the nice thing about that deal is they’ll verify which of their products my apps will run on before they list them. Also recently, an Android gaming peripheral company sent me some sample hardware I can use for integration with my games. After the strict parenting from Apple, I feel Android is loving and warm. It’s nice to be wanted.
