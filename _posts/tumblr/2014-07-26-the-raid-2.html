<p>One of my Comic Con traditions is Ric Meyer&rsquo;s Kung Fu film festival. It has a more extravagant name and isn&rsquo;t just Kung Fu, but it is all action. The first one I attended clued me in to the The Raid: Redemption, considered by some to be the best martial arts film of all time.</p>

<p>This time, for those of us who haven&rsquo;t seen the sequel, he showed clips from Raid 2. also considered by some to be the best martial arts movie of all time. Holy moly, it&rsquo;s violent. It&rsquo;s awesome. Here&rsquo;s the official trailer.</p>
