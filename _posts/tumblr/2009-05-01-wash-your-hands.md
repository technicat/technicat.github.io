With the swine flu, I’m no so much worried about the border or airplanes (well, I’m always worried about airplanes). I’m worried about the admonition for everyone to wash their hands. Have you seen a public bathroom? I’ve seen a Starbucks bathroom with no hand soap. I’ve been in a Borders bathroom where I guy walked out of a stall, picked up the smoothie he left on the sink, and walked out without washing his hands. Now, that’s gross.

Maybe more people would wash their hands if hand-drying was fun. At the Long Beach Airport, I saw the [Dyson Hand Dryer](http://www.dysonairblade.com/homepage.asp). That thing was cool.
