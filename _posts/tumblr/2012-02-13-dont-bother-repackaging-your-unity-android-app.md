To get in on the [free Playbook offer](http://www.pcworld.com/businesscenter/article/249243/rim_offers_free_playbook_to_attract_android_developers.html) that expires today, I tried to run [HyperBowl](http://hyperbowl3d.com/) through Rim’s Android online repackager, but no go - apparently it can’t handle native code. So for now, I guess if you want your Unity game on the Playbook, you’ll have to rely on Unity to port it through their [Union](http://blogs.unity3d.com/2011/05/03/first-wave-of-union-games-for-blackberry-playbook-revealed/) program.
