<p>I was recently approached by a publisher about preparing a Korean version of <a href="https://market.android.com/details?id=com.technicat.HyperBowl">HyperBowl for Android</a>, so I looked into localization packages for Unity. There&rsquo;s a free one listed somewhere on the Unity forum and at least a few on the Asset Store - I settled on the <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=5&amp;ved=0CDoQFjAE&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fu3d.as%2F1Ya&amp;ei=A2DcTum6CILMiQKil4yFCg&amp;usg=AFQjCNGV5Ex2kwj8STkH-LEoxTmJbIjkTQ">M2H Localization Package</a>. It&rsquo;s got a pretty cool Google Docs feature, where you can have Google Translate fill in spreadsheet entries and then download that into your Unity project with a button click. Leaving translations up to Google Translate is a bit risky, but the good people of La Petite Baguette went over the French translation with me and it turns out Google Translate did a passable job. I also updated <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/hyperbowl/id344209253">HyperBowl on the App Store</a> with this new language support (iOS has many more selectable languages than my Samsung Galaxy Vibrant) - so far I&rsquo;ve got French, German, Korean and Japanese.</p>
