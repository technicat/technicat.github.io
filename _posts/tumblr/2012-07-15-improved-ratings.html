<p>The App Store rating summary provided by AppViz shows much better ratings for the latest versions of all my apps than for all versions of all my apps. Either my apps have improved, people have gotten nicer, or Apple&rsquo;s fix to avoid accidental one-star reviews has really worked. Probably a combination of all three.</p>
