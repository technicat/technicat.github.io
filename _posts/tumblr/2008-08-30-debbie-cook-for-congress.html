<p>Amid all the hubbub surrounding the presidential race, there&rsquo;s a pretty interesting contest going on around here, <a href="http://www.ci.huntington-beach.ca.us/">Huntington Beach</a> Mayor <a href="http://www.debbiecookforcongress.com/">Debbie Cook</a> challenging <a href="http://rohrabacher.house.gov/">Dana Rohrabacher</a> for his congressional seat. I don&rsquo;t know much about either except from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debbie_Cook">Cook&rsquo;s wikipedia page</a> (interesting story of a suburban mom getting involved in local environmental issues, going to law school and then running for mayor, but reads like it was written by her people) televised <a href="http://www.ci.huntington-beach.ca.us/government/elected_officials/city_council/">Huntington Beach City Council</a> meetings on<a href="http://huntingtonbeach.granicus.com/MediaPlayer.php?publish_id=3"> HBTV</a>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dana_Rohrabacher">Rohrabacher&rsquo;s wikipedia page</a> and all the taxpayer-paid newsletters he sends me.</p>

<p>Personally, Cook strikes me as fairly level headed and competent (e.g. in an exchange with Council member <a href="http://www.gilcoerper.org/">Gil Coerper</a> about <a href="//articles.latimes.com/2007/jul/18/local/me-nakedman18">public nudity</a>), and Rohrabacher, despite his long career in politics, strikes me as an alarmist idiot - The Mexicans are coming! An asteroid is falling! Boycott the Olympics! (although I admire the bravado and intent behind that last one)</p>

<p>But make up your own mind - you can research Rohrabacher&rsquo;s voting record on <a href="http://votesmart.org/voting_category.php?can_id=26763">VoteSmart</a> and see Cook in action in archival footage of the <a href="http://huntingtonbeach.granicus.com/ViewPublisher.php?view_id=2">Huntington Beach City Council meetings</a>.</p>
