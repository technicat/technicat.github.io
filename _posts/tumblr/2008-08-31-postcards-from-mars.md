With the recent Olympics, invasion of Georgia, elections, Hurricane Gustav, and Paris Hilton’s energy plan crowding the news, it’s easy to forget the [Mars Phoenix Lander](http://phoenix.lpl.arizona.edu/index.php) is still digging away. It has just completed it’s primary 90-sol (Martian-day, nearly 40 minutes longer than an Earth day) mission and has its term officially extended until September 30.

Here’s a shot of early-morning frost:

And don’t forget the [Mars Rovers](http://marsrovers.nasa.gov/home/index.html) are still roving. Opportunity just climbed out of [Victoria Crater](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victoria_(crater)) - here’s the exit view:

And this is a front hazcam view from Spirit (which is currently recharging its batteries):

By the way, I cribbed the title of this blog from a [very cool book by Jim Bell](http://www.postcardsfrommarsbook.com/).
