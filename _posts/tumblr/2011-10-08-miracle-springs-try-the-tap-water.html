<p><em>Originally written on Epinions in March 2004:</em></p>

<p>On my last drive from LA to Phoenix, I thought it was about time I stopped on the way and checked out what&rsquo;s in between. I considered spending the night in Palm Springs, but after sitting in my car for three hours just getting out of the LA freeway system, the warm waters of Desert Hot Springs sounded inviting.</p>

<p>So instead of turning south off I-10 to Palm Springs, I drove north a few miles to the <strong>Miracle Springs Resort and Spa</strong>. For some reason, I was half-expecting the hotel to be surrounded by bubbling hot springs in the desert sand, but instead the complex encloses eight spas and a pool fed by hot and cold underground aquifers, respectively. The hotel itself is next to a residential area and close to the small downtown area but it&rsquo;s pretty much flatland here, so the view is fairly unrestricted.</p>

<p>After a lengthy check-in wait (the desk staff seems a tad disorganized - there was much discussion amongst them about which rooms were available), I declined to sign up for the spa treatments (yes, mud facials are for men, too), which run $70 on up, and trudged off to my spacious king-bed room, which turned out to be quite spacious, featuring a sofa, balcony with mountain view, mid-sized refrigerator and large TV (at least 27&quot;) with cable.</p>

<p>The pool and spas were too populated for my taste in the afternoon, with a largely senior crowd (apparently drawn by the reputedly curative nature of the spring water), but the crowed seems to thin out in the evening. Armed with towels they gave me at the desk and some trunks I bought at the very-small gift shop, I tried out one of the spas around 8pm - families with kids seem to come out at that time but I found a spa to myself. The waters are actually cooled a bit before arriving in the spas and I would have preferred a little more heat, but still, it was quite relaxing to lay back in the water and look at that starry desert sky.</p>

<p>After soaking in a near-trance, I eschewed dining in the Joshua Tree restaurant (Joshua Tree National Park is nearby), and opted for room service. I ordered a Miracle Burger, their homemade cheesecake, and after a game of guess-what-beer-we-have, a Heineken. (It&rsquo;s Miller and Bud country out there) They did warn me that they were busy and the meal would take 30 minutes to prepare, and they were right. And the server omitted to leave utensils with the meal, but was otherwise courteous. The burger was decent (hardly a miracle) and the cheesecake was pretty good, even as finger food. I was advised by the gift shop cashier to try the town&rsquo;s famous tap water, since it also comes from below, and I have to say, it&rsquo;s not bad, but probably deserves more comment than my unsophisticated water-tasting skills can discern.</p>

<p>I was tempted to try breakfast in the restaurant the next morning (I was intrigued by the stuffed French toast), but it was just as well, since checking out was a mirror image of my check-in routine. A long wait - although the line was short, the desk attendants appeared to be short-handed and tied up with answering phones. They were quite friendly while discharging me but turned to quibbling with each other as I exited the lobby. Maybe they needed to take a dip.</p>
