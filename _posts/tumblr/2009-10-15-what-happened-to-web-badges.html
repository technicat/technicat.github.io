<p>I decided to spruce up the <a href="http://hyperbowl3d.com/">HyperBowl</a> site by replacing some links with web badges. But it seems like the meaning of<a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_badge"> web badge</a> has changed - it used to be just a little graphic that links to the advertised site. Now when I search for official web badges on the Facebook or Twitter sites, I get these monstrous Javascript and Flash widgets (I use twitter and Facebook widgets on the <a href="http://fugugames.com/">Fugu Games</a> site, but they ain&rsquo;t pretty)</p>

<p>It took me a while, but eventually I figured out the new nomenclature is &ldquo;press logo&rdquo; - search for that, and you can find the nice official JPEG and PNG images (and by the way, nice of Internet Explorer to finally support transparent PNG&rsquo;s!) Ah, much better!</p>
