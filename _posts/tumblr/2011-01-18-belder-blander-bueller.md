This caught my eye when I checked the [Unity forum](http://forum.unity3d.com/) on my [Unity Feed](http://itunes.apple.com/app/unity-feed/id400855804?mt=8) app recently. Two of the top three posts are about [Blender](http://blender.org/), but misspell it in the title (actually it appear to be the same post, edited and misspelled differently each time). It’s not as bad as the one I saw today that misspelled “help” in the title (possibly the poster was distracted by also typing it in all caps and appending a row of exclamation marks), but still, how about a little open source respect!
