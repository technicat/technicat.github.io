But lately, it seems on-screen MIT is getting cooler. The Jeff Goldblum character in Independence Day was not Revenge of the Nerds nerdy, but he was pretty nerdy. The MIT grad in NCIS is a nerd, but a nerd who packs a gun. And the tech-savvy security guy in the series Vegas seems too cool for school, not to mention MIT. The portrayals lack some authentic details, though, including, if memory serves:

- Real MIT students have a “concentration”, which is one or two numbers, not a major with a name (especially not “computer forensics, like on NCIS).
- Real MIT students say "that’s orthogonal” when presented with an irrelevant issue.
- Real MIT students start off the day by talking about how many hours of sleep they didn’t get last night. Or the night before.
- Real MIT students will utter “IHTFP” when placed in an uncomfortable situation.
I can’t wait to see a character with these traits on TV - imagine a sleep-deprived investigator who intersperses numbers and “that’s orthogonal” into his or her speech, joneses for the dun-dun noodles at Mary Chung, and curses “IHTFP” before every gun battle. Oh yeah, our hero should wear a really ugly ring.
