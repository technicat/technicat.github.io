<p>Here&rsquo;s what happened to my download speed after I once again hit the data limit in my Android Unlimited Data Plan - the first time from attempting to update XCode, the second from updating my Android SDK (some irony there?)</p>

<p><a href="http://itshardtofondlepenguins.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/Screen-shot-2011-04-03-at-1.26.34-PM.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4428" title="Screen shot 2011-04-03 at 1.26.34 PM" src="http://itshardtofondlepenguins.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/Screen-shot-2011-04-03-at-1.26.34-PM.png" alt="" width="780" height="454"/></a></p>

<p>I went to the T-Mobile forums to point out the misleading use of the term &ldquo;unlimited&rdquo; and to ask what the limit actually is, but someone beat me to it last month, also pointing out the limit is listed as 4GB in the contract Terms and Conditions but subject to change at any time and not mentioned by T-Mobile personnel at the time of purchase. And of course, someone else had to argue that it was not misleading since the limit in the unlimited data plan is mentioned in the fine print (must have been someone from marketing, legal or just a helpful idiot - if Google ever hires me, my Google Friday project will be the Google Idiot Filter).</p>

<p>Still, it is with dread that I see the news of the possible merger with AT&amp;T. When my Android phone started malfunctioning a while ago, T-Mobile sent me a warranty replacement in the mail in two days (and with an upgrade to Android 2.2 - bonus!) I was a little surprised to find a $10 charge for the replacement in my bill, but that didn&rsquo;t ruin my lunch. Compare that to my 5-day trial of AT&amp;T&rsquo;s mobile broadband - I had no 3G coverage despite the salesperson&rsquo;s confident assurance, and even after getting a refund on the modem, still received a $100 bill, including a charge for the full next month (&ldquo;we don&rsquo;t prorate&rdquo;, explained their customer &ldquo;service&rdquo; rep). Sure, joining AT&amp;T means getting access to the iPhone, but if it comes to that, I&rsquo;ll just switch to Verizon. Out with the old Borg, in with the new.</p>
