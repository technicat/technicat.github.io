I just linked my AdMob account to App Annie and was instantly rewarded with a new insight: my AdMob revenue now exceeds my iAd revenue. Or in other words, Android ads are making me more money than iOS ads.

This is a recent trend. For a long time, my iAd revenue has dominated. And I’m still way down from that spike a couple of years ago.

My App Store earnings are still higher when you include sales figures, but overall, the gap is closing (and my Amazon sales have improved lately, so if you include that…). Apple, you’re still my most important platform. But just barely.
