I’m tempted to wait until the end of this series so I could title the blog No More Mr. Nice Guy, but here’s the trailer. It’s a bit different from the other Korean dramas I’ve been watching - still melodramatic, but very dark - everyone’s bad to some extent, and a lot of the mystery is how bad are they. And the acting among the leads is excellent. Dig that dead-eye stare at the end of the trailer.
