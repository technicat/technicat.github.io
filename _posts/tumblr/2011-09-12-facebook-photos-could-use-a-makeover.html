<p>If it&rsquo;s easier to use your web service from a mobile device than your web site, that&rsquo;s an indication your web site could use some improvement. Take the Facebook photo chooser for example. My favorite part of the iPhone Facebook app is the photo uploader. Choose a photo, then upload. It&rsquo;s even easier on my Android phone. There, I can upload directly from the photo album. On either device, I can choose the album I want to upload to, but I always choose the default.</p>

<p>But from a desktop browser, photo upload is longer and more confusing process. If I choose upload from the main Photos page, I&rsquo;m prompted to create a new photo album. That&rsquo;s almost never what I want, so I back out and enter the album I want to upload to. Then after the upload, I&rsquo;m asked if I want to publish the photo, but specifically the photo I just uploaded, but all unpublished photos, and I&rsquo;m shown all the photos in the album with no indication which ones are published or not published, or even which photo was just uploaded.</p>
