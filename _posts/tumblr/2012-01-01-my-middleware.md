2011 was the year of middleware for me. At the beginning of the year, I was using Unity and Unity iOS, of course, plus the game center and iAd plugins from [prime31](http://prime31.com/). Then I started using the Etcetera plugin (initially for the photo chooser, but the web view and spinning cursor is useful, too), [GUIKit001](http://gameassets.net/) for pause menus, [iTween](http://pixelplacement.com/itween) (every non-trivial animation in [HyperBowl](http://hyperbowl3d.com/) is scripted with iTween), Unity Android, OpenFeint, AdMob and Etcetera plugins for Android, [EZGUI](http://anbsoft.com/) to replace pause menus that were showing up corrupted on Android (apparently a UnityGUI issue), the Transitions Manager from [DFT Games](http://dftgames.com/) for an additional splash screen on all my apps, the [Free Texture Pack from Artskillz](http://www.artskillz.net/devBlog/lang/en-us/2011/02/25/artskillz-is-on-unity-asset-store/) to add more wall textures to [Fugu Maze](http://itunes.apple.com/app/fugu-maze/id295808255), and the Localization Package from [M2H Games](http://m2h.nl/), and along with that, the [Japanese fonts](http://u3d.as/content/masashi-wada/selected-u3d-japanese-font/1A4) from the Unity Asset Store.

Actually, much of the middleware packages I’m now using are from the Asset Store (exceptions are the prime31 plugins and GUIKit001 - the latter was cheaper from their web site). There is of course the convenience of browsing and downloading into Unity, easy access to updates, I always look for good reviews (especially for packages that cost money), and I don’t have to worry about the license (compared to all the sample projects that I probably downloaded from the Unity forum in 2008). Also, there’s plenty of free stuff - part of my mission statement is to try out every free package!
