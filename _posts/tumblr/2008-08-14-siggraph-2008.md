I haven’t been to [Siggraph](http://siggraph.org/) for several years, but since my client [Avatar Reality](http://avatar-reality.com/) is exhibiting there, I figured I should check it out. (For a really cool presentation on Avatar Reality’s Blue Mars project, check out the web site and artist roster of one of their partner companies, [Virtual Space Entertainment](http://www.virtualspaceentertainment.com/))

Siggraph is one of those events where old-timers catch up. I was only there for a few hours but ran into my old colleague Larry Malone of [Izware](http://www.izware.com/), and he introduced me to [Craig Reynolds](http://www.red3d.com/cwr/), inventor of [boids](http://www.red3d.com/cwr/boids/).

I heard the number of exhibits is down from previous years, but there was plenty to see for one afternoon. It seems there’s a resurgance of modelling packages, after it seemed like [Autodesk](http://www.autodesk.com/) was going to swallow everyone up. For my own game development, I checked out [RocketBox Libraries](http://rocketbox-libraries.com/) for ready-made animated characters, but I just checked their web site and it’s pretty expensive for assets that can only be used for one product. [Organic Motion](http://organic-motion.com/) showed an impressive-looking motion capture system that requires no optical markers (look Ma, no ping pong balls!). But it will be a sad day when Siggraph no longer features lithe women prancing around in black spandex.
