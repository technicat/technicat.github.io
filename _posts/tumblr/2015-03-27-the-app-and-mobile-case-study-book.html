My rating: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/928170094">3 of 5 stars</a><br/><br/>
It&rsquo;s a interesting list of apps, but all the &ldquo;case studies&rdquo; are written by the app developers or publishers or ad agencies, so some of them read more like press releases than postmortems.
