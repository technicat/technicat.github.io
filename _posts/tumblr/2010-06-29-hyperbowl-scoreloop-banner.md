I logged into my Scoreloop developer account recently and discovered some changes, among them the option to specify a banner for email notifications. I uploaded one for [HyperBowl](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/hyperbowl/id344209253?mt=8) and checked out how it looked in a challenge notification. Ideally, the graphic would include the game name but I chose one that was already close to the recommended aspect ratio.
