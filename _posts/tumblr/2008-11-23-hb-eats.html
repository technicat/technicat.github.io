<p>One of the more polished iPhone apps (featured in on one of the Apple ads) is from <a href="http://urbanspoon.com/">UrbanSpoon</a> - shake your device, the display spins and clicks like a slot machine and settles on a random eatery in your vicinity.</p>

<p>But after a couple of days trying it out, it seemed to be repeating itself, and so far had only shown me one restaurant I haven&rsquo;t visited. That, and driving around, you might think Huntington Beach is a wasteland of strip malls with Del Tacos, Sizzler&rsquo;s and Starbucks, but it&rsquo;s really not that bad. It&rsquo;s no Manhattan, but if I decide to do strike a blow against global warming and dependence on Middle East (or Canadian, for that matter) oil, I have quite a few options for lunch within a mile - decent Thai, Japanese, barbeque (although the folks at <a href="http://tfphb.com/">The Front Porch BBQ</a> didn&rsquo;t know what I was talking about when I asked for fried okra) and a pretty good breakfast/lunch place called the Good Day Cafe.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, Chinese isn&rsquo;t well represented (it seems any place with &ldquo;Wok&rdquo; in the name doesn&rsquo;t hold much promise). But if I venture further to the next strip mall, there&rsquo;s yet another Thai place (last count I&rsquo;ve been to seven in the HB area) called Sea Siam and a very good Japanese place, <a href="http://slowfishusa.com/">Slowfish</a>, where I can get ramen, udon, and eel on rice.</p>

<p>And then on the way back, to cool off after a spicey seafood ramen, I can get a $1 scoop of Aztec chocolate or mint with chili powder ice cream at Znow&rsquo;s, which somehow, in an out-of-the way strip mall next to a Quizno&rsquo;s and Starbucks, made it on the radar to be named <a href="http://www.ocweekly.com/bestof/2008/award/best-ice-cream-256718/">OC Weekly&rsquo;s Best of OC Ice Cream.</a></p>

<p>Oddly, HB residents don&rsquo;t seem all that adventurous about dining, or at least walking to dining. One of my neighbors didn&rsquo;t recognize any of the restaurants I named. And when I first moved here for work, my coworkers just ate at the Westminster mall food court. But I&rsquo;m not much of a culinary explorer compared to the<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/17/nyregion/17bigcity.html?_r=2&amp;scp=1&amp;oref=slogin"> twelve-year old New York food critic</a>.</p>
