I was going to blog about iPhone development, but given the holiday, I’ll reprint a review of a self-published novel, [Carl Melcher Goes to Vietnam](http://www.carlmelcher.com/), written by a Vietnam vet that I received at an Epinions meet and greet. I was pleased to hear later that the author, Paul Clayton, found a publisher for the book.

_From Epinions, May 2005_

Finally, I’ve gotten around to reading Paul Clayton’s **Carl Melcher Goes to Vietnam** after receiving a copy at an Epinions Meet and Greet last year. In truth, I made a few abortive attempts at starting the book, but the first-person narrative by young draftee Carl Melcher begins slowly - the tone of the first chapter describing Carl’s transport to Vietnam for his tour of duty seems sterile and his travelling companions uninteresting and somewhat unlikable.

In the context of the whole book, I think it works. The autobiographical feel of the book is strengthened by the understated narrative. Carl is not a poet or activist or John Wayne. Carl is the Everyman soldier who’s in Vietnam because he doesn’t feel he has a choice. Yet when he arrives, the experience is almost a disappointment. It’s almost like a trip to summer camp, bunking for a few months with some new buddies, and despite the helicopters and bombing runs and mortar fire and wounded and dead, contact with the enemy is so infrequent that Carl develops a half-serious theory that the whole thing is an elaborate hoax.

There are casualties among Carl’s friends, much of it self-inflicted by “Keystone Cops” bungling, but Carl’s fatalistic go-with-the-flow attitude seems to be working - he even falls for a local girl (and I mean girl - she’s just a teenager, which seems a bit shocking until you realize so is Carl) and plans on prolonging his stay in Vietnam to be with her. There’s even a bit of Catch-22 bureaucratic fumbling with his personnel file, so it seems like there might be a happy ending in store for Carl.

But this is not a story, it’s real life and real war, and in particular it’s the Vietnam War where politicians posture at peace talks while soldiers try to survive their tours of duty despite themselves, an unpredictably hostile populace and an often faceless enemy. Carl survives, but his friends don’t. He returns home as if awakening from a bad dream, but as the book leaves off, it seems it’s not a dream that he can shake.

This may seem like a pointless ending to the story, but that’s the point. **Carl Melcher Goes to Vietnam** may lack the morality implications of **Platoon** , the existentialism of **Apocalypse Now** or the detailed battle intensity of **We Were Soldiers** , but it feels real enough that I’d like to know how much of it stems from the author’s experience.
