[![Perfidia](https://d.gr-assets.com/books/1400865622m/20262505.jpg)](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20262505-perfidia)[Perfidia](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20262505-perfidia) by [James Ellroy](https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/2887.James_Ellroy)  
My rating: [3 of 5 stars](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1219879192)  
  
I may have to reread the author’s other books, as I recall being totally absorbed them, and Perfidia, being a prequel, features the same characters and jazzy prose. But while I didn’t quite have to slog through the chapters, I didn’t find the characters that compelling or sympathetic, particularly with the constant racial slurs. That’s nothing new in Ellroy novels and can be taken as natural patter in context, even taken ironically, but I can’t help feeling the author enjoys writing these words a bit too much, in a Tarantino-esque way. But kudos for placing the Japanese-American internment at the center of the story, even if you don’t buy the conspiracy theory.
