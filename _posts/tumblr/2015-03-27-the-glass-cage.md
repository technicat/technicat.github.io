[![The Glass Cage: Automation and Us](https://d.gr-assets.com/books/1402607236m/20723810.jpg)](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20723810-the-glass-cage)[The Glass Cage: Automation and Us](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20723810-the-glass-cage) by [Nicholas Carr](https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/151353.Nicholas_Carr)  
My rating: [3 of 5 stars](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1190121297)  
  
The author brings up a lot of interesting points and case studies of how automation can have the opposite of the intended effect, but halfway through, I feel he is belaboring the point without bringing up solutions (he does mention an improved approach to design, but in a manner that suggests there is some kind of entrenched conspiratorial resistance to it). And I felt like asking him, I bet you’re using a word processor, and not using a typewriter (like Elmore Leonard) or handwriting the book, and you haven’t even turned off the spell checker, right?
