<p>When I try out new mobile games, the first thing I look at is the credits screen, to see how many people worked on it. Even better are the postmortems on gamasutra - I skip to the end of each to see the personnel count and the project duration. I just did a search for &ldquo;postmortem&rdquo; on gamasutra and this is the data I got from a quick scan for iOS projects:</p>

<p>2/1/2012 - Spellcraft School of Magic - 6 months, 6 contributors<br/>
6/22/2011 - Casey&rsquo;s Contraptions - 8 months, 1 programmer, 1 artist,<br/>
12/15/2009 - Top Gun - 4 months, 6+ developers</p>

<p>The team size may vary, but based on this, I wouldn&rsquo;t schedule any significant new mobile game project under six months, and I expect that to increase over time as hardware capabilities improve, more social gaming and monetization doodads are required (the price of &ldquo;freemium&rdquo;), player expectations increase (where&rsquo;s the postmortem on iFart?), and more device support is required (Top Gun was only for the iPhone - now you have a few generations of iPhones and iPads to target).</p>

<p>This was just a crude search - a more careful one reveals many more articles that provide similar information, so really, if someone tells me they can have Angry Birds success for $5000 (this really happened to me at E3), then someone didn&rsquo;t do their homework. And we haven&rsquo;t even talked about marketing, yet!</p>
