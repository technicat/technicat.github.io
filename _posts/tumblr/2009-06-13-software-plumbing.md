We code monkeys like to have intellectual-sounding titles - like computer scientist or software architect (definitely not “code monkeys”). Why architect? It’s analogous to computer architect, but that’s also kind of weird (in college, I told an architecture major I wanted to be a computer architect, and she said that’d be great - she needed some software to help with her work). I blame Ayn Rand and Hollywood - the cool people in film and TV are always in advertising or architecture firms.

But I think plumber might fit our job description better. A while ago my bathroom shower and toilet started filling up with sewage, coming dangerously close to overflowing.

The plumber came, tut-tutted, walked around the complex and the parking garage trying to find out how everything was connected, pointed out that the system was an unholy mess and whoever put it together didn’t know what they were doing, said it would take a lot of time and money to rebuild the whole system correctly, in the meantime they’d look for a quick fix, couldn’t find a way to do it, had to arrange over a few days for a bunch of cars to be moved so they could flush and drain the pipes while I asked all my neighbors to please stop using their toilets, and then they fixed it in the nick of time.

During that whole process, I was thinking that this is in fact the story of my career - “hey, what’s this supposed to do” ,“ who designed this system anyway?” (a software architect), “I inherited this problem” (a familiar refrain from the Obama administration), “I’ll look for a quick fix but can’t promise anything”, and everyone’s favorite, “this thing should really be redone from the ground up”. Actually, I never say that last one - that’s where the software architect comes back into the picture.
