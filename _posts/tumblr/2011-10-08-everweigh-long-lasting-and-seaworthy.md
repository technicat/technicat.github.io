_Originally written on Epinions in May 2004:_

In an embarrassing lapse of tub management, I recently overflowed my bathroom. One of the apparent casualties was my **Health-O-Meter EverWeigh** scale. With water still dripping out the bottom, I gave it a try - the required initial foot-tap to activate it showed signs of life - the expected “888” display on the LED - but I just got “00” when I put my full weight on it. But after leaving it on the floor for a day, I tried the scale again and it displayed the expected reading (which I won’t state here).

More expected than this impressive water-resistance is the battery-life. The scale is powered by a non-replaceable lithium battery (I looked for an obvious way to open up the scale and there is none), and I’ve had this scale for as long as I can remember, probably at least five years (which I believe is the typical warranty on these things), so I’m just guessing that I paid $15-$20 for it. The whole casing is plastic, so it is very light and easily carryable with the handle formed above the display.

The EverWeigh is easy to use, but I don’t like having to tap and wait for the scale to activate - once in a while I need to tap it multiple times to get the required “888” then “0” to show up (the LED display has three digits, with precision to one pound). Foot placement on the scale appears to be important - you’ll get different readings if you’re off to the side a bit - so some markings would have been nice. I normally take more than two or three readings, until I’m satisfied that I’ve got two identical readings in a row. I don’t have another scale to compare the accuracy with, but a recent weighing at my doctor’s office gave me a number consistent with the EverWeigh’s readings.

My biggest displeasure is that the EverWeigh doesn’t work on carpeting, which rules out use in one of my bathrooms. The written info underneath the scale states that it is less reliable on heavy carpets, but that’s quite an understatement. My carpet is not at all heavy, but apparently I weight fifty pounds less on it.
