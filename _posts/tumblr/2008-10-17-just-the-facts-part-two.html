<p>Last week, I saw <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barry_Sonnenfeld">Barry Sonnenfeld</a> on the <a href="http://lateshow.cbs.com/latenight/latelate/">Late, Late Show</a> complain about the short attention span of kids these days, what with all the texting and web surfing. I&rsquo;m with him on that, but then he complained that with the web, people just believe the first thing they read. I don&rsquo;t know about that - when I google a subject, I get pages of links, and I&rsquo;m usually motivated enough to at least check a few. Compare that to someone who just watches Fox News all day.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t think the newer generation is particularly research-impaired compared to the old, either. For instance, Sonnenfeld also claimed that McCain and Bush had Osama Bin Laden stashed away in order to be popped out as a trophy just before the election. What kind of fact-checking went into that theory?</p>

<p>And how about that elderly lady at a McCain rally who said she&rsquo;d heard that Obama is an Arab? She probably got her rumors wrong - the predominant rumor is that Obama is a Muslim (though you&rsquo;d think that having to publicly disavow his crazy pastor would have settled that). Lost amid the accusations and denials - the assumption that a Muslim running for president is somehow a bad thing. (I can imagine Muslims across the nations saying, &ldquo;Hey, wait a minute&hellip;.&rdquo;)</p>

<p>I seem to have the opposite problem of Obama&rsquo;s. Whenever I offer the tidbit that I am descended from Chinese Muslims (and apparently by some interpretations, that makes me a Muslim), the reaction is typically an exercise in denial - &ldquo;No way. You can&rsquo;t be. How can that be?&rdquo; It&rsquo;s as if I said I was a Scientologist (although in LA, I guess that&rsquo;s no big deal).</p>

<p>Speaking of science fiction, after reading a short story in which everyone was required to relocate every few years so they didn&rsquo;t set down roots, I had the idea of a society where everyone was required to marry another race, on the theory that there&rsquo;s no racial strife if it&rsquo;s all in the family. And then after seeing what happened in the former Yugoslavia, I thought that idea could be extended to religion. I never actually thought up a story, but I still think mixing it up makes things a lot more interesting (think outside the box!) So let me give a shout out to my cousin Ben and his blog, <a href="http://benkoo.com/">The Unadulterated Gospel of the World&rsquo;s Greatest Chinese Jew</a>.</p>
