It’s only been a week since the last [Fugu Maze](http://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=295808255&mt=8) update, but I couldn’t wait to add the photo picker from the Unity iPhone Enhancement Pack. Double-tap the screen, and you can paper the walls of your maze with baby photos or cat photos (at least, that’s what I tested with).

To avoid confusion with the single-tap operation of the flashlight, I decided to just leave the flashlight on.
