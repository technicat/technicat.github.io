My regular weekend routine includes randomly dropping into open house showings of properties I still can’t afford. But the realtors are pretty cool about it (often complaining the owners need to get real and drop the price further).

On a recent drop-by, I mentioned how nice the [Brightwater](http://www.brightwaterhb.net/) development on the [Bolsa Chica](http://bolsachica.org/) wetlands was turning out, despite the [birds-slamming-into-a-wall fiasco](http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-bolsa27nov27,1,7770023.story?coll=la-headlines-california&ctrack=1&cset=true), and the realtors informed me of another controversy - regular [local demonstrations](http://natube.magnify.net/item/BNDTHT6THDFWT3F4) over alleged [mishandling of Native American burial sites](http://ocvoice.wordpress.com/2008/04/01/bury-my-heart-at-brightwater/) by the developer.

This isn’t the first time this has happened - similar controversy arose (after the fact) with the [Harbor Cove](http://articles.latimes.com/1997/nov/03/local/me-49809) development in Newport Beach. Haven’t these guys seen [Poltergeist](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0084516/)?
