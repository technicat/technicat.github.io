<p>I usually check &ldquo;one employee&rdquo; on those game industry surveys, but I&rsquo;m tempted to include my cat. It&rsquo;s taken me a while to figure out here play preferences, and I think I may have gleaned some general lessons:</p>

<p>She always likes to play right after she eats. This surprised me, since I like to take a nap a big meal, but I have to admit, I don&rsquo;t like to play hungry, and I usually play after a late-night snack. So maybe games should reward you with Taco Bell coupons after each achievement, or automatically place an order to Pizza Hut over the Internet. Or maybe something more nourishing if you&rsquo;re playing a long RPG.</p>

<p>She likes to at various times in the day, but especially late at night, around 2AM. Same here - currently, I try to get in some Fallout 3 before bed.</p>

<p>She shows only mild interest in most toys, but she goes crazy over one toy that appears to be just the right shape, size and furry texture to mimic some kind of animal. It&rsquo;s the only toy on which she administers a neck-breaking chomp-shake (I&rsquo;m glad she&rsquo;s only six pounds) and then trots off with it victoriously in her mouth. So a certain type of realism is required.</p>

<p>The realism doesn&rsquo;t have to be exact. If I had to choose, I&rsquo;d say the toy resembles a mouse, but there&rsquo;s no head or tail, and I wave it around on a wand so it&rsquo;s more like a weird mouse-bird hybrid.</p>

<p>Physics/AI/animation are important. She&rsquo;ll poke at the toy if its just sitting there, but doesn&rsquo;t get interested unless I wave it around and drag it around in some realistic simulation of an animal scurrying/flying around. The toy loses some appeal after the springy attachment between mouse and wand gets stretched out.</p>

<p>The difficulty level has to be tuned to the player. The cat is engaged as long as the mouse toy is within reach and she is ready to play again and again if she succeeds in catching it. If I just plop it in front of her, she won&rsquo;t got for it, and if she chases it around for a while and can&rsquo;t catch it, she gives up.</p>

<p>Breaks are necessary. With frequent breaks, the cat can play all day.</p>

<p>You can charge a premium for the most best games. This toy is $10, but a better value than all the cheap toys the  cat ignores.</p>

<p>Games can be addictive. When my cat isn&rsquo;t eating, sleeping or pooping, she wants to play, and that&rsquo;s several times a day. She&rsquo;ll bite my legs when she wants to play (that&rsquo;s when I play may game &ldquo;Do you want to eat or play? Speak, dammit!&rdquo;) She&rsquo;ll get anxious if I stow the toy away in the closet. Cat rehab, anyone?</p>
