<p>While I was moving nearly every year I managed to avoid getting called for jury duty, but now that I seem to have settled down in Orange County, I get called to jury duty every other year, like clockwork. I never got selected as a juror, until last month. In the spectrum of civil duties, this is hardly an onerous one. You just have to sit in a jury box for a few days, take notes and hash out some decisions with a bunch of people in a room. It&rsquo;s like a really long meeting. And I hate meetings, but I did learn some things:
</p><ul><li>I don&rsquo;t like spending money on lawyers, but don&rsquo;t try to act as your own attorney. This defendant did, and there were times when I wanted to object.</li>
	<li>Orange County pays $15/day for jury service. Which compares favorably to iPhone app sales.</li>
	<li>Six jury members were Asian. Now, how many TV shows based in California show more than one Asian? (it&rsquo;s one of my hobbies - &ldquo;spot the Asian&rdquo;). And all you people worried about Latinos taking over&hellip;don&rsquo;t forget about us!</li>
	<li>It turns out taking Edinger from Huntington Beach to Santa Ana is faster than taking the 22.</li>
	<li>You can&rsquo;t take your notes out of the courtroom. Which is too bad for the juror next to me who was drawing some really nice pictures.</li>
	<li>A lot of us were self-employed (considerately, the judges with long trials did not call anyone who was self-employed).</li>
	<li>Despite what I see on TV and the Internet, there are responsible people. Everyone on the jury did a conscientious job, and only a couple in the selection pool tried to get out of it. Compared to the last time I was called, it was a relief to see no one got confused by &ldquo;do you understand the defendant is innocent until proven guilty?&rdquo; and this time no one pretended not to understand English.</li>
	<li>Always eat a little beforehand. Ironically, a lesson I learned when I took the LSATs a long time ago and pissed off everyone else with my loudly grumbling stomach.</li>
	<li>Despite taking the LSATs, and a continuing interest in the law (I&rsquo;m a big Scott Turow fan), I&rsquo;m glad I&rsquo;m not a lawyer.</li>
</ul>
