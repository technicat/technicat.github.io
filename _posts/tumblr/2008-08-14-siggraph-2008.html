<p>I haven&rsquo;t been to <a href="http://siggraph.org/">Siggraph</a> for several years, but since my client <a href="http://avatar-reality.com/">Avatar Reality</a> is exhibiting there, I figured I should check it out. (For a really cool presentation on Avatar Reality&rsquo;s Blue Mars project, check out the web site and artist roster of one of their partner companies, <a href="http://www.virtualspaceentertainment.com/">Virtual Space Entertainment</a>)</p>

<p>Siggraph is one of those events where old-timers catch up. I was only there for a few hours but ran into my old colleague Larry Malone of <a href="http://www.izware.com/">Izware</a>, and he introduced me to <a href="http://www.red3d.com/cwr/">Craig Reynolds</a>, inventor of <a href="http://www.red3d.com/cwr/boids/">boids</a>.</p>

<p>I heard the number of exhibits is down from previous years, but there was plenty to see for one afternoon. It seems there&rsquo;s a resurgance of modelling packages, after it seemed like <a href="http://www.autodesk.com/">Autodesk</a> was going to swallow everyone up. For my own game development, I checked out <a href="http://rocketbox-libraries.com/">RocketBox Libraries</a> for ready-made animated characters, but I just checked their web site and it&rsquo;s pretty expensive for assets that can only be used for one product. <a href="http://organic-motion.com/">Organic Motion</a> showed an impressive-looking motion capture system that requires no optical markers (look Ma, no ping pong balls!). But it will be a sad day when Siggraph no longer features lithe women prancing around in black spandex.</p>
