<p>One reason I usually buy even non-Apple items from the Apple Store is the theory that anything sold there is less likely to exhibit Mac compatibility issues. I think it&rsquo;s a good theory. I bought a LaCie Rugged drive at the Apple Store that worked immediately in the classic plug and play sense. Now, two years later, I saw a Western Digital MyBook at Staples for half the price and six times the storage - time for an upgrade. When I connected the MyBook to my MacBook Pro, the drive reassuringly mounted and displayed both Windows and Mac files, including a directory labelled &ldquo;MyBook for Mac&rdquo;. The Apple online store lists rave reviews for MyBook for Mac. This, however, apparently was MyBook Not For Mac. The Mac apps on the disk were runnable but unable to do anything except hang or show exclamation marks with blank error messages.</p>

<p>Googling showed that the first step upon purchasing a MyBook Not For Mac is to reformat it for the Mac. This is a surprisingly obtuse operation, particularly if you want to use the drive for Time Machine. You have to run the Drive Utility app in the Application-&gt;Utilities folder, go to Partition, select Mac Journalled, Case Sensitive, be sure to hit the Options button and select the middle radio button (the non-Windows option), then partition (of course, make sure you&rsquo;re partitioning the right drive!)</p>
