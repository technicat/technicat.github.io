I’m on my fifth iPad keyboard, now (and I’ve only had three iPads). The first was Apple’s keyboard, which typed OK but had a stand that only supported portrait orientation and wasn’t flat, so it was like carrying a big rock. After that, I tried a Logitech-branded keyboard made by Zaag which was great - the keyboard had a great feel, and it functioned as a stand and case. But the iPad 3 was too big for it and frequently fell out of the stand with an annoying clang. The new Zaag fit better, but not enough to avoid the occasional fall, and the keys popped off when I dropped the case. I also tried an Adesso keyboard which functioned as a more complete case, but I didn’t like the feel of the keyboard.

But finally, this Logitech Ultrathin Keyboard, which I’m guessing is also made by Zaag, is looking good. The keyboard feels good, like a Zaag, it is ultra thin, and it seems to have a magnet in the stand slot to keep the iPad from falling out. Unlike the other Zaag’s there’s also a magnetic hinge, which I don’t think is very useful but looks cool.
