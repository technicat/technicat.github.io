With the restoration of the [Bolsa Chica](http://www.bolsachica.org/) wetlands, the water’s looking cleaner and the birds are coming back (despite the risk of slamming into [The Glass Wall of Bolsa Chica](http://www.seaandsageaudubon.org/Conservation/TheGlassWall.html) - see [OC Birder Girl](http://ocbirderca.blogspot.com/2007/11/birds-of-bolsa-chica-versus.html) for more details).

I’m not a birder, but a I walked right by this guy - I think it’s a [snowy egret](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snowy_Egret).
