Converting my Unity iOS apps to Unity Android was a cinch. For most of the apps, nothing had to be changed in the scripts, and most of the asset changes were manual texture and sound format conversions for optimization.

This biggest pain in the neck so far has been the icons. Naturally, Android icons have to differ greatly from iOS icons - different sizes and no automatic rounding of the corners. There is a rather elaborate set of [Android icon guidelines](http://developer.android.com/guide/practices/ui_guidelines/icon_design_launcher.html), but the short summary is that you need a 48x48 and 72x72 version and they look best with a transparent background.

Fortunately, I managed to dig up a suitable graphic with transparent background for [HyperBowl](https://market.android.com/details?id=com.technicat.HyperBowl) and [HyperBowl Pro](https://market.android.com/details?id=com.technicat.HyperBowlPro) (I wish Iâ€™d learned graphic design skills in school, along with home repair and contract law), but not for my other apps, yet, except a somewhat crude attempt on [Fugu Bowl](https://market.android.com/details?id=com.technicat.FuguBowl), and you can see the difference.
