<p>I feel like the last to know, but I just read the news that <a href="http://www.sarahconnorchronicles.org/">The Sarah Connor Chronicles</a> won&rsquo;t be picked up by Fox for next season. I&rsquo;m shocked, shocked I say. The time slot did suck - even though it was my favorite show of last season and had an arc where you don&rsquo;t want to miss an episode, I kept forgetting when it was on (Friday at 8pm - now I remember, but too late). But once I discovered the episodes available on the Playstation Store, I downloaded the episodes I missed onto my Playstation 3, and then ended up downloading all of Season 2 (leaving just enough room for a few episodes of <a href="http://blogs.amctv.com/breaking-bad/">Breaking Bad</a> and <a href="http://www.dollverse.com/">Dollhouse</a>)</p>

<p>Speaking of Joss Whedon&rsquo;s Dollhouse, I wonder if Fox decided that one Friday sci-fi show was enough for them. That would be ironic, considering Fox also killed Whedon&rsquo;s Firefly, one of my all-time favorite TV shows (at least Fox is consistent). By the way, Firefly introduced Summer Glau to sci-fi fans, and there&rsquo;s speculation that Glau will end up on Dollhouse. Maybe this is a devious master plan by Whedon. Or maybe while there&rsquo;s nothing good on TV, I&rsquo;ll have to invent my own conspiracy theories.</p>
