Ironically, now that Apple doesn’t allow promo code users to post review on the App Store, I feel freer to dispense codes, particularly on toucharcade where it has seemed to me that posting codes generates some in-forum enthusiasm and a lot of requests for more codes, but not actual sales, and only App Store reviews when someone gets disgruntled (like when I started requiring iOS 3.0 as a minimum).

I still have promo codes to burn (so I sort of wish Apple didn’t give out promo codes at all - it really is time-consuming getting rid of these things), so after a long absence I posted some more [HyperBowl&nbsp; promo codes on toucharcade](http://forums.toucharcade.com/showthread.php?t=95640). The other problem I have every time I do this is that I can’t remember the special markup tags, and for some reason they’re not easy to find within toucharcade, but once again, google found the [documentation](http://forums.toucharcade.com/misc.php?do=bbcode).

Really, so far I just have two tags that I need to remember so far: [appinfo=all] inserts the App Store description and link, and [youtube] embeds a YouTube video (maybe I’ll upgrade to [hdyoutube] or [hqyoutube] next time).
