This is why I’m no longer checking my Facebook feed. Facebook keeps prompting me to promote my pages, and the Hide option doesn’t seem to work. I suspect it’s actually saying I don’t want to see my own pages, because the Report option only allows me to complain about my own pages. You keep messing with the feed, and I no longer want to look at it (tumblr and twitter, take note).
