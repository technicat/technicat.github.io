<p>If this isn&rsquo;t the first time you&rsquo;ve looked at this blog, you&rsquo;ll see I&rsquo;m using a new theme, iFeature (the free version), from Cyberchimps (link at the bottom of this page). It&rsquo;s pretty fancy schmancy - on the other end of the spectrum from the elegant and simple Twenty Eleven theme (check it out my sister&rsquo;s site, <a href="http://alphagirlcomics.com/">Alpha Girl Comics</a>). Both themes are easily accessible from the WordPress Theme section of the dashboard on on Wordpress.org.</p>

<p>One big improvement over my previous theme is this one contains some of my sprawling images that were running over the side. It also adds a product section, a footer for widgets, social icons and built-in share/like buttons. The most time-consuming part here is finding images for the &ldquo;slider&rdquo; section above the posts - for it to look good, they have to be about the same size.</p>
