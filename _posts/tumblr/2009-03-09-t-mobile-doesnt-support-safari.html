<p>After several failures logging in to my T-mobile account in Safari, I tried Firefox and it worked. Belatedly, I googled for the problem and found this <a href="http://discussions.apple.com/thread.jspa?messageID=9093129">report</a> that says T-mobile doesn&rsquo;t support Safari. A huge telcom can&rsquo;t test more than two browsers? In this economy, they can&rsquo;t hire one more QA person? Are they still waiting to see if this Mac thing will take off? Or are they peeved at the exclusive AT&amp;T iPhone deal? I guess I should be relieved they don&rsquo;t just support Internet Explorer, but now I have to install Firefox just to pay my phone bill!</p>
