<p>In my previous post, I described how the Cantonese text-to-speech feature in Mac OSX. That feature is in iOS, too, but not in an as obvious a location. To activate, bring up Settings, go to Accessibility, Speech Selection, enable it and add Chinese (Hong Kong SAR China) to the Voices.</p>

<p>Now when you select Chinese text, there&rsquo;s a &ldquo;Speak&rdquo; option, with Cantonese as one of the languages (Japanese is the other). This setup works almost as well as on the Mac with Google Translate, except on Google Translate for iOS the translation results are not selectable. On the other hand, it does have a cool handwriting entry option, so you can draw Chinese characters, listen to them in Cantonese and translate them to English!</p>
