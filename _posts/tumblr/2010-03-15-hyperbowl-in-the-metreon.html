<p><a href="http://hyperbowl3d.com/">HyperBowl</a> originally debuted in the Metreon (the Sony Metreon back then) ten years ago but I heard it had been removed a few years ago, and I don&rsquo;t recall seeing it during GDC 2008. But at last week&rsquo;s GDC, I wandered up there and there they were. Looking good, too (don&rsquo;t be fooled by the awful quality of my cell phone photos). This is the original concept - to emulate the feel of a real bowling alley.</p>
