While I was updating my [HyperBowl](http://hyperbowl3d.com/) site to make room for a [new review from Unity Insider](http://www.unity-insider.de/vorgestellt/app-check/585-hyperbowl), I decided to take another look at adding a Facebook badge for the [HyperBowl fan page](http://facebook.com/hyperbowl), since there’s some room on the sidebar, and the simple web badge I had there is kind of dull and easy to ignore (it looks like all my other Facebook web badges, but they point to different fan pages!). I avoided the official badge before due to its size and its display of fans’ profile photos. I guess it bothered some other people, too, as I see that’s now not an option. It also looks better - simpler and cleaner, and fits in better on my page sidebar.

I also decided to check out the Facebook Insights for the fan page, and that’s also much improved, with a lot more graphs, including aggregate user info, which I suppose might bother some people, but I do find the information interesting, like this one:
