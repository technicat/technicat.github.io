<p>My upcoming book on Unity iOS is now available as an alpha on the <a href="http://www.apress.com/9781430248750">Apress site</a> (and also a preorder on Amazon, which for some reason is cheaper). Actually, I think the alpha&rsquo;s been available for a couple of weeks now, since it&rsquo;s on page 3 of the alpha list (or they&rsquo;ve been cranking them out for SXSW). Anyway, the alpha currently has five chapters in near-to-final state (behind the scenes, another three are pretty near done), the rest in various states of draft. Accompanying projects are currently in-progress on <a href="http://github.com/technicat/LearnUnity">github</a>.</p>
