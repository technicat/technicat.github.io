<p>I&rsquo;m playing around with paper.li again. I tried it a year ago, but it stopped updating after four days and I forgot about it. This time I have <a href="http://paper.li/fugugames">Technicat News</a> set to auto-tweet, so we&rsquo;ll see how that goes, and I&rsquo;ve included included it in all my <a href="http://facebook.com/technicatllc">Facebook pages</a> using their Facebook app. Their small web widget is too animated for my taste include in my web site sidebars, though, and the big one is too big, and doesn&rsquo;t show up in this blog, but here&rsquo;s a screenshot:</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll see how the updates look and try tweaking the feeds (I don&rsquo;t see manual curating in my future).</p>
