<p>Someone pointed out this Koi Pond app to me. It&rsquo;s pretty nice - tapping the screen gets you a nice ripple effect and chases away the fish. And it&rsquo;s neat to have an app that you can hold in any orientation (look Ma, no HUD!)</p>

<p>I decided to check for fish-screensaverish apps based on the Unity engine. I think this was the first one, Artifishal Life (points for the name!)</p>

<p>And a more recent, more deluxe one, 3D Fish Tank (and it&rsquo;s apparently more resource-intensive - I had to reboot my iPod touch to get this one started)</p>
