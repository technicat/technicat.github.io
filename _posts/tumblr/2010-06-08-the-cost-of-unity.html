<p>I recently ponied up for the Unity 3.0 preorder, which prompted to wonder how much I&rsquo;ve invested in Unity overall so far. Checking over my WorldPay emails:
</p><ul><li>$249 on October 2006 for Unity Basic 1.5 after seeing a demo at WWDC</li>
	<li>$1289.14 on Auguest 2007 for an upgrade to Unity Pro in a promotion for the Unity 2.0 release</li>
	<li>$399 on October 2008 for Unity iPhone Standard</li>
	<li>$1100 on November 2008 for an upgrade to Unity iPhone Advanced</li>
	<li>$1000 on June 2010 for a preorder upgrade to Unity 3.0</li>
</ul>
So, about $4000 over for years. Not bad (at least, cheaper than my health insurance!)
