There’s been furor in the past over flag-burning, but to me, the real desecration of the flag occurs when people co-opt it for their own causes. I was recently nauseated by a Facebook campaign against the proposed Muslim worship center in New York, largely by the use of the American Flag as their logo. But I should get over it - the tactic is pretty much a cliche by now.

For example, here is an over-the-top logo for the [Huntington Beach Police Officers Association](http://hbpoa.org/):

A more clever use is on the “about us” page of the [Video Game Voters Network](http://videogamevoters.org/):

Nowhere does it explain on that page that the group is founded and run by the [ESA](http://www.theesa.com/), the industry group representing game publishers. That type of omission leads the conspiracy theorist in me (and I didn’t even know I had one) to wonder who was behind the anonymous mass mailings in the[IGDA](http://igda.org/) that led to Tim Langdell’s ouster. Anyway, for my civil liberties advocacy, I’ll count on organizations like the [ACLU](http://aclu.org/) - at least I know who they are.

And liberal groups are not immune, either. [MoveOn](http://moveon.org/) exercises this tactic (and others normally attributed to Fox News), but with a bit of subtlety here - they have some stars and stripes sneaking in around the borders and background:

It’s an unseemly replacement for discourse. Which flag is bigger, yours or mine?
