I’m not working on HyperBowl Plus (I don’t think anyone has for ten years). All my versions of HyperBowl are newer and built on the Unity game engine. I have Windows versions on gamejolt.com and itch.io, e.g.&nbsp;[https://technicat.itch.io/hyperbowl](https://technicat.itch.io/hyperbowl)&nbsp;and I’m working on a Windows Store version (I’ve had one request for Steam, too). For the old version of HyperBowl, you can try turning on Windows Compatibility Mode.
