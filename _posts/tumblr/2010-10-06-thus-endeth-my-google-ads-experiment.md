Well, once again I gave Google AdSense a try, and once again, I decided to drop it. The experiment was somewhat illuminating, although based on a small sample size, just a few days. Not surprisingly, I got more impressions from my [Technicat](http://technicat.com/) site, which I know garners the most traffic, but the [HyperBowl](http://hyperbowl3d.com/) site generates the most click-throughs.

Snooze. Nevertheless, it’s small change, there are some annoying looking ads (a big gaudy vertical banner touting Orange County coupons?), and I just noticed something I didn’t like in the program policies - check out the last line in this partial listing: Sites with Google ads may not include or link to:
- Pornography, adult or mature content
- Violent content
- Content related to racial intolerance or advocacy against any individual, group or organisation
I think it’s poorly worded. Can I speak out against racial intolerance? And I reserve the right to advocate against any organization (Fox News, Microsoft, MoveOn, city hall…) or individual (CNN anchors, for example). The policy prohibits not just including such content but linking to such content. Guess I’ll remove those links to…everything. Actually, the first two lines are pretty dubious, too. No “adult” or “mature” content? What does that cover? Nudity? And “violent” content? I can’t link to a boxing site? Or review the latest PS3 shooter? Obviously, with all the Google Ads showing up on blogs, this is not an enforced policy, and I’m sure it’s well-intentioned (or at least cautious in a don’t-get-us-sued sense), but it reads like something that might have leaked over from their China compromise.
