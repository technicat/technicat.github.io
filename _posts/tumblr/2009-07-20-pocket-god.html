<p>An Apple ad moment occurred during dim sum this weekend - everyone pulled out their mobile devices, mostly iPhones (including my iPod touch) with a couple of Blackberries in the mix, and started comparing apps. The favorite was <a href="http://pocketgod.blogspot.com/">Pocket God</a>.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s interesting that everyone wasn&rsquo;t so much playing a game as just playing. No bragging about high scores - just showing each other how to create lightning, start a tidal wave&hellip;OK, it sounds cruel, but really, this thing is exploratory fun. You can drag just about anything - change the time of day by dragging the sun, incinerate something by pulling the magnifying glass over it, levitate or launch the pygmies (toward the volcano)&hellip;and none of this Game Over buzzkill, just drop more pygmies, birds, sharks to keep things going. For $.99 on the App Store, it&rsquo;s a deal.</p>
