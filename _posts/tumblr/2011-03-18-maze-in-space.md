With the iPhone App Store, I started out submitting little apps like [Fugu Maze](http://itunes.apple.com/app/fugu-maze/id295808255?mt=8) to get the hang of it before submitting my big app, [HyperBowl](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/hyperbowl/id344209253?mt=8). That worked out fairly well. With the Mac App Store, I started out with HyperBowl, and so far it hasn’t been promising. It took a while just to get it working because I’d made so many changes since the last stable version in December, the mouse movement values Unity gets from the Magic Mouse are problematic (I basically ask you if you’re using a Magic Mouse, not ideal), and the app was stuck waiting for review for four weeks, so long I was wondering if it was really waiting for review, then it was under review and rejected quickly because the reviewer didn’t know how to get out of the menu screen. After I dashed off a reply saying click on the flashing red button, it went back to “in review”, and has been there for a week.

So I decided oh well, let’s try to get something out of that $99 I paid to get on the Mac App Store, and submitted Fugu Maze. There are some differences in submitting a Mac app vs. iOS app, including the screenshots. I suppose it’s not really a difference since they’re both full-screen, but on a Mac if you’re running your app in a window, that means your desktop is showing (pardon me!) With Fugu Maze, I think the result is a nice sci-fi look, a maze lost in space. I hope that doesn’t happen to it on the Mac App Store!
