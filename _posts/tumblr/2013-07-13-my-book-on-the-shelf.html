<p>At last, <a href="http://learnunity4.com/">my book</a> is on the store shelves (this is an advantage of going with Apress as a publisher - they have a strong retail presence). At my local Barnes and Noble, I found it nestled against Visual Basic Programming for Teens.</p>

<p>This might seem surprising, but if you&rsquo;re not self-publishing, it&rsquo;s actually easier to track print sales than ebook sales. Amazon&rsquo;s Author Central displays BookScan numbers, which aggregate print book sales from various retailers, including Barnes and Noble and Amazon.com (too bad Borders is no longer around - would have loved to see my book there). The stats are incomplete, since not all retailers participate, but still, it&rsquo;s better than nothing.</p>
