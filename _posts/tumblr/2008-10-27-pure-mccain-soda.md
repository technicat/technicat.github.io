A quick dinner from one of the [Famima](http://www.famima-usa.com/) stores (basically, Japanese 7-11’s, but better) in downtown LA. Two steamed buns and a special election edition of [Jones Soda](http://www.jonessoda.com/) - [Pure McCain Soda](http://www.jonessodastore.com/shop/product.php?productid=16366). It’s pretty tasty, get it while it lasts! (I assume until the election, unless McCain wins, in which case, maybe they’ll keep selling it for another 4-8 years)

I’m disappointed at the absence of drinks named after the other candidates. Can I offer you an Obama Kool-Aid? (That’s a gimme) A Palin Wild-Salmon Pepsi? (Ok, stretching) Barq’s Biden Root Beer? (Hmm, I guess it’s not that easy…)
