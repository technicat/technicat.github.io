<p>These are good times for web standards purists. If you want your web site to be readable on iPhone&rsquo;s and you did it all in Flash, you&rsquo;re screwed. There are some Apple extensions that can be used by web pages targeted to the Safari browser on the iPhone, but if you stick to standard HTML and CSS, avoid some Javascript tricks like mouseovers, and avoid plugins like Java and Flash, you&rsquo;re fine.</p>

<p>I guess I lucked out. After years of horrible hand-crafted layouts, I switched my <a href="http://www.technicat.com/">Technicat</a> site to <a href="http://apache.forrest.org/">Forrest</a>, which adhered so strictly to <a href="http://w3c.org/">W3C</a> standards it didn&rsquo;t even support Javascript, much less Flash or Java. For my <a href="http://philipchu.com/">personal site</a>, I tried iWeb, and since I keep ignoring its repeated suggestion to upgrade to iLife 08, there&rsquo;s no way I can add any content there that is incompatible with the iPhone Safari browser.</p>

<p>And I did experiment with authoring my entire <a href="http://fugugames.com/">Fugu Games</a> site in Flash, but after realizing that it wouldn&rsquo;t be amenable to search engines, it just showed up as a blob in the <a href="http://archive.org/">Internet Archive</a>, and I was a pretty lousy Flash developer anyway, I went back to handcrafted HTML and CSS, inspired by the <a href="http://csszengarden.com/">CSS Zen Garden</a>. My results aren&rsquo;t as impressive (if you&rsquo;re a good graphic designer and an HTML/CSS expert, you&rsquo;re all set!), and like a web critic Goldilocks would summarize, my first attempt was too tall (for laptop screens), my second was too wide (for the iPhone), and this third one is just right (I hope).</p>

<p>The iPhone web browsing experience does accomodate Quicktime movies embedded in web pages. I&rsquo;ve spent a lot of time trying out all the video serving options offered by my ISP (Flash streaming, Quicktime streaming), but I&rsquo;ve concluded it&rsquo;s just easier to upload everything to YouTube, which will do the conversion for you, allow you to embed the movies in your web page, and make them available in the iPhone YouTube app.</p>

<p>Now, I still have get everything to look right in Internet Explorer. If you&rsquo;re interested in seeing how IE compatibility has doubled the work of web developers, just Google for, say, &ldquo;Internet Explorer CSS&rdquo;</p>
