<p>Apple provides daily and weekly download stats for your apps on the <a href="http://www.apple.com/iphone/appstore/">App Store</a> in the form of plain text files. But you don&rsquo;t need to wrangle them into a spreadsheet program - the handy <a href="http://blog.fieryferret.com/2008/10/appstore-clerk.html">Appstore Clerk</a> presents a simple tally.</p>

<p>I only bother downloading the weekly reports. This app shown above was fairly popular in its first week, but then after I started charging for it, the download rate dropped dramatically. The upgrade figures spike whenever I release a new version, and the handful of weekly new buyers perked up a bit during the holidays.</p>

<p>This next app wasn&rsquo;t as initially popular, and in my own opinion was less polished, so I kept it free. As can be seen from all the zeroes in the update column, I haven&rsquo;t released a new version (until just recently), and it also had a declining download rate, but didn&rsquo;t diminish as much as I expected. I was also surprised by the uptick during the holidays. Hmm, maybe that one has more potential than I thought&hellip;</p>
