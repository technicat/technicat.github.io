<p>In principle, I have nothing against ads. And I&rsquo;m not saying that just because I have a few dozen apps with banner ads. But, like Sally in When Harry Met Sally, I like my ads on the side. No paid and undisclosed promotional links. Everything in its own area in a clearly marked advertising section.</p>

<p>But like a Sneaky Pete, ads are encroaching into content. At first it looks harmless, nestling into a corner of the text.</p>

<p><a href="http://itshardtofondlepenguins.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/IMG_0072.png"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-6060" alt="IMG_0072" src="http://itshardtofondlepenguins.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/IMG_0072.png" width="1229" height="922"/></a></p>

<p>And then, while no one is looking, it drifts down the column, now firmly wedged in.</p>

<p><br/><a href="http://itshardtofondlepenguins.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/IMG_0079.png"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-6053" alt="IMG_0079" src="http://itshardtofondlepenguins.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/IMG_0079.png" width="1229" height="922"/></a></p>



<p>Now it&rsquo;s free to burrow into the bowels of the text, like an intestinal parasite.</p>



<p><a href="http://itshardtofondlepenguins.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/IMG_0076.png"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-6054" alt="IMG_0076" src="http://itshardtofondlepenguins.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/IMG_0076.png" width="1229" height="922"/></a></p>

<p>Finally, like invading pod people, it blends in with the crowd.</p>

<p><br/><a href="http://itshardtofondlepenguins.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/IMG_0071.png"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-6065" alt="IMG_0071" src="http://itshardtofondlepenguins.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/IMG_0071.png" width="1229" height="922"/></a></p>

<p>At this point, it&rsquo;s a barely disclosed paid promotional link. The only thing left is to remove the disclosure. We have to draw the line somewhere. I say, respect the borders of the text. Keep it convex. And stay out of my backyard!</p>
