<p>I saw my <a href="http://philipchu.com/">about.me</a> page has a couple of more services that I can link in (besides LinkedIn, har har). One is forkly, which looks a lot like foursquare but focuses on rating specific dishes. They have a nice-looking iPhone app, but the listing is limited, so I only managed to rate a plate of fish tacos and a Peruvian rotisserie chicken (OK, now I&rsquo;m thinking about lunch already).</p>

<p>The other service is smarterer, which features a bunch of crowdsourced online timed quizzes in various fields. I had an instinctively negative reaction when I saw Excel among the top suggested quizzes. Then investment banking. Finally I tried Introduction to Programming. It&rsquo;s not too bad, but I thought some of the phrasing was weird, and also the selection - the first question was &ldquo;which of these are programming languages&rdquo;, and later, a bunch of C++ syntax. What I couldn&rsquo;t stand, however, was the misspellings. Here&rsquo;s the second one I encountered, upon which I gave up on the quiz (besides, I ran out of time while taking this screenshot)</p>

<p>Also, I remembered, I hate taking quizzes.</p>
