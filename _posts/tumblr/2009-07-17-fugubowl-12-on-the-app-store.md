The OS 3.0 update for [FuguBowl](http://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=297032758&mt=8) is on the App Store. This is a very simple show-off-a-game-mechanic game, but it’s free, so aside from the new/update-release spikes, there’s a steady 10-20 downloads a day.

The latest update also includes new controls also used for the iPhone version of [HyperBowl](http://www.hyperbowl3d.com/) (still pending approval).
