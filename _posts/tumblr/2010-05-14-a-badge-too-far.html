<p>The ABC Player on my iPad is by far the leading consumer of my iPad hours - I&rsquo;ve been catching up on episodes of Lost, Flash Forward, V, Modern Family&hellip;But do they have to have that ABC badge constantly on-screen? Admittedly it&rsquo;s smaller than most of the logos on television, but on a bright background it&rsquo;s still very noticeable. And it&rsquo;s the ABC Player - it only features ABC shows. By the time I select a show and hit Play, I&rsquo;ve got the message.</p>
