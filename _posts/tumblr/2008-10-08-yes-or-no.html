<p>In last night&rsquo;s presidential candidate debate, moderator Tom Brokaw at one point preceded a question by saying it &ldquo;requires only a yes or no&rdquo; answer. I don&rsquo;t find long-winded campaign responses absorbing (I intermittently switched to <a href="http://www.cbs.com/primetime/two_and_a_half_men/">Two and a Half Men</a>), but if we reduce the candidate positions to binary, then what&rsquo;s the point of having a debate? They could fill out a survey and save two hours of TV time.</p>

<p>Brokaw reminded me of a manager who irritatedly insisted &ldquo;yes or no&rdquo; when I tried to give an informative response (she accompanied this with a foot stomp, which perhaps indicated I should respond one stop for no, two for yes). I&rsquo;ve noticed management and marketing often get impatient asking for a &ldquo;straight answer&rdquo; from software engineers (hey, we&rsquo;re not as bad as lawyers), but the short answer isn&rsquo;t going to save you time. The aforementioned manager once asked me where to find a game file used for testing, stomped off when I started to explain there were additional files that needed to be included, and then came back later to ask why it wasn&rsquo;t working. Imagine if more important decisions were made that way, like &ldquo;Does Iraq have weapons of mass destruction? Yes or no!&rdquo; Oh, wait&hellip;</p>
