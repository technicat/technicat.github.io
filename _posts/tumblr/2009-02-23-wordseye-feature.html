<p><a href="http://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=305827351&amp;mt=8">WordsEye Feature</a> is now on the App Store. It displays a random scene created and &ldquo;featured&rdquo; on the <a href="http://www.wordseye.com/">WordsEye web site</a>.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s passive entertainment, but I think it&rsquo;s one of the more interesting apps I have on my iPod Touch. The images look great, and the source text scrolling by gives you an idea how they were created.</p>
