Lately, I’ve been seeing this ad where a young woman says she had an epiphany in the back of a taxi that “Windows should be simpler.” So she told Microsoft and they took her suggestion! I’m jealous, partly because it never occurred to me that Windows should be simpler, and also because last time I called up Microsoft, to ask them to stop billing me for the Hotmail account that Best Buy signed me up for when I bought a PC there, they kept transferring me to successively less cooperative and articulate phone reps and then charged me for an additional month. I guess I should have opened with, “Hey, I have an idea for you - Windows should be simpler. And give me my $20 back!”
