Much as I like to see my apps listed on as many web sites as possible (well, not the piracy sites), I’m not impressed by the ZDNet site. The screenshot is squashed, the text grabbed right off the iTunes page has lost formatting, the category description is vaguely “mobile” and also confusingly mentions “other PC games”.

Worst, you have to register just to click on the link to the real download site which they’re not even hosting, and in doing so, you get spam.
