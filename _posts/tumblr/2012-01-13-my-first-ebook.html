<p>Now that I have a NOOK Color for app development and probably will have to buy a Kindle Fire, too, I figured I might as well see what&rsquo;s involved in self-publishing ebooks on those platforms. At first, I looked at <a href="http://smashwords.com/">Smashwords</a>, which has the convenience of upload-one-publish-everywhere, where everywhere includes iBooks, Nook and Kindle. It&rsquo;s free, except you have to obtain an ISBN for iBooks, which will cost a few bucks of you get it from Smashwords. But you have to upload your book in Word format.</p>

<p>So I&rsquo;m trying out the Barnes and Noble <a href="http://pubit.barnesandnoble.com/">PubIt</a> self-publishing program. Also free, no ISBN required, and it supports a variety of upload formats, preferably ePub (which is what everything else converts to). So for my first attempt, I collected all my <a href="http://technicat.com/writing">Technicat essays</a>, pasted them into Apple Pages and formatted the document with the sample ePub styles provided by Apple for use in creating iBooks, then exported and submitted it. Overall, it&rsquo;s a heck of a lot easier than submitting an app! Not to mention you don&rsquo;t have to go through an app review period. But from the number of new releases just for today, I can see it&rsquo;s even harder to stand out from the crowd - it took me a while to realize that <a href="http://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/technicat-on-software-phil-chu/1108218697">my book</a> actually showed up on the store yesterday. To my relief, the book looks a lot better on the device than in Pages, and the TOC shows up properly in the Contents menu, but I can&rsquo;t believe after all these years I still have errors in the text! That&rsquo;s one good thing about self-publishing ebooks, as with apps - it&rsquo;s easy to update.</p>
