Much as I might complain about people who only download free apps, I spent a day last week downloading all the free packages I could find on the Unity Asset Store. The interface isn’t super-convenient for that - I had to go through each category, sort by price, and then try to remember if I’d downloaded each one already. But hey, bargain-hunting takes some legwork. And before the Asset Store arrived, I was rooting through Unity demo projects for reusable assets. This is the mother-lode by comparison (the pic below is just a small section of my download list). And if you’re willing to part with five or ten bucks, there’s plenty more available!
