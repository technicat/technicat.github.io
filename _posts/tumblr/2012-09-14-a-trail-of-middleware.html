<p>I&rsquo;m not really familiar with Torque but I&rsquo;m under the impression it never had the ecosystem of extra middleware that Unity has - the plugins, assets and tools that surround it like pilot fish around a shark (that doesn&rsquo;t sound very nice but I mean it as a compliment). Here&rsquo;s a list off the top of my head of commercial Unity extras that I&rsquo;ve actually used and deployed (not all at once):</p>

<p>iPhone Enhancement Pack<br/>
iAd, AdMob, iCade, Game Center and Etcetera plugins from prime312<br/>
iTween<br/>
GUIKit001<br/>
EZGUI<br/>
NGUI<br/>
Localization Package<br/>
Transitions Manager<br/>
inneractive plugin<br/>
Scoreloop plugin<br/>
Openfeint plugin<br/>
Zeemote SDK</p>

<p>I could have sworn that I used more, and this doesn&rsquo;t include art and sound assets, but in any case, I&rsquo;ve got a long list that I haven&rsquo;t got around to, yet.</p>
