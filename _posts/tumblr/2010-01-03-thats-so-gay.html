<p>Well, I voted for Neil Patrick Harris as the <a href="http://www.afterelton.com/bgwe/12-23-09?page=0%2C6">Best Gay/Bisexual Man of the Decade</a>, although I wish I could also have voted for George Takei and David Hyde Pierce. The title of the list is a bit misleading - as noted in the article it&rsquo;s really the best pop culture gay/bisexual man of the decade (in an all-time all-category list I&rsquo;d vote for names like Michelangelo and Alan Turing).</p>

<p>But two steps forward, one step back, as they say. Remember those PSA&rsquo;s on network TV with Wanda Sykes admonishing us to stop saying &ldquo;that&rsquo;s so gay!&rdquo; I haven&rsquo;t seen those for a while, but I do still see reruns of Two and a Half Men ignoring Wanda&rsquo;s advice and saying exactly that. And I just deleted a comment on a Facebook fan page from a teenager who informed me that charging for a game is &ldquo;gay&rdquo; (after demanding more free gameplay in all caps). But he is a kid and apparently immature and possibly overindulged by his parents. Television screenwriters - what&rsquo;s your excuse?</p>
