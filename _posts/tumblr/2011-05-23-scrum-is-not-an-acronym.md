I don’t know whether people assume process names are capitalized or if they just like to see them that way. Or maybe it’s from all those James Bond stories involving SPEKTRE and SMERSH. In any case, I’ve seen the scrum methodology listed in job postings and even training sessions listed as SCRUM, and even agile as AGILE.

It’s really a waste of good marketing. I’ve met a lot of marketing people who seem to think programmers don’t have a clue about marketing (it’s the reasoning that I can’t do what they do so they can’t possibly do what I do), but scrum, agile (and don’t forget extreme programming) were coined by software developers and cleverly impart an athletic flair to an activity involving mostly rapid typing and mouse clicking. I think they may appeal to the wannabe athletes in us, or at least the Red Bull drinkers. It’s a contrast with the “waterfall” life-cycle of development - slow, steady and peaceful, but sounds pretty.

Meanwhile, the manufacturing types have dull names like TQM and ISO 9000, but maybe they’ve seen the light - the Six Sigma process features Black/Green/Yellow Belt certifications.
