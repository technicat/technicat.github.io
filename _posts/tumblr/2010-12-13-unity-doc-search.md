I just tried out the [doc search Unity add-on](http://pixelplacement.com/2010/11/14/doc-search-for-unity/) from pixelplacement. It’s not as world-changing as iTween, but it’s one of those tools that removes a constant annoyance. Whenever I want to look up a Unity script function, I have to go to the Unity help menu, select Script Reference, then perform a search. This lets me perform the search within Unity. It only saves me one step, but if&nbsp; you count the total original operations as two steps, that’s 2X improvement! And bonus, you can specify whether you want to search locally or on the web, and while the Unity Help menu only searches locally, I’d rather search on the web, since half the time I’m searching for a link to pass it on to someone else.
