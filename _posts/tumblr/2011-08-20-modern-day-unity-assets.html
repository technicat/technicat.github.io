<p>I looked at the wikipedia article on Unity recently and was pleasantly surprised to see it link to <a href="http://drupal.technicat.com/games/unity/assets">Assets</a> section of my Unity tutorial (it&rsquo;s not really so much a tutorial perhaps as a guide, or, things I wrote down so I won&rsquo;t forget?) Anyway, even though I updated it a little bit with a mention of the Asset Store a while ago, it could use some refreshing, since I started writing it back when Unity automatically gave you Standard Assets or Pro Standard Assets when you created a new project. Now there are so many starter assets, they&rsquo;ve been separated into various packages.</p>

<p>And I only just realized that same asset import dialog also lists anything you&rsquo;ve downloaded from the Asset Store (not for the first time, I could have used a &ldquo;Scroll down you idiot!&rdquo; user interface prompt).</p>
