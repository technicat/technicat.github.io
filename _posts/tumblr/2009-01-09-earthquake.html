<p>After getting jolted by an earthquake last night, I tried to find news of it - nothing on TV, although the local stations were all over it an hour later, but I found near real-time earthquake tracking on the <a href="http://earthquake.usgs.gov/eqcenter/shakemap/sc/shake/10370141/">USGS site</a>, complete with a map of recent activity:</p>
