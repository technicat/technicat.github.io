I submitted HyperBowl on a [Unity 3.0](http://unity3d.com/) release candidate this weekend, so I thought I could take a break from Unity until the final release. But that came today (while I was searching futility for the strawberries in my Fresh&Easy strawberry rice crispy cereal - cruel disappointment), so time to get cracking on that web player. In the meantime, hereâ€™s a screenshot of the newly-added San Francisco lane from the submitted app, looking fine in HD on my 4th-gen iPod touch:
