<p>When I started watching Korean drama, I found it all utterly fascinating and absorbing. Like Dr. Jin, which featured in its first episode a doctor who time-travels back to ancient Korea. After watching four other time-travel series that year, I realize that&rsquo;s not a unique premise in kdrama (another popular story setup is an alternative-universe modern Korea that still has a monarchy). I also now realize Dr. Jin was pretty bad, albeit entertainingly bad, and I&rsquo;m getting pickier, to the point that lately I&rsquo;ve been having trouble finding a new show that really grabs me.</p>

<p>But I&rsquo;m getting that must-see vibe with The Healer, which features the cute-as-a-puppy Park Min Young (another draw of Dr. Jin, before I realized every show has really good-looking actresses, if they haven&rsquo;t overdone it with the plastic surgery). The show actually feels a lot like City Hunter (Korean version, also featuring Park Min Young, not the Jackie Chan version which I haven&rsquo;t seen), with the action and music. By the way, I recommend City Hunter, too - that&rsquo;s one of my faves. I have to wait and see on The Healer, as they&rsquo;re only up to episode 6 (kdramas usually show two episodes in quick succession every week, and around 20 episodes total except for weekend and daily dramas which go up to fifty or even over a hundred episodes). Sometimes, maybe most of the time, shows peter out or just wander into weird directions after the halfway mark. Anyway, here&rsquo;s the trailer for The Healer, which even without subtitles shows a bunch of the standard kdrama elements (but not the piggyback ride&hellip;)</p>
