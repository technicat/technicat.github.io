_Originally written on Epinions in June 2005:_

Science is boring. Science is magic. That’s pretty much the way science is presented and viewed in the U.S. and probably explains a lot why it’s hard to grow scientists in this country. My high school science education included a biology teacher who informed my class that he was only teaching evolution because he was required to, and a “gifted” program where instructors who knew science education but not science related how famous discoveries were found in dreams and held contests where we ran around smashing cubes of ice in a frenzy of scientific creativity.

Science is far more complicated and interesting than that - like anything else worth anything it boils down to dirty work performed by people with varying talent and motives (and sanity), at the whim of politics and circumstance. All the stuff of a good soap opera - or in these days, a reality show. In **The Electric Universe: The Shocking True Story of Electricity** , author David Bodanis brings to life the struggles and rivalries behind the discovery and application of electricity.

Or to be more precise, electromagnetism. The author tracks the application of electricity from its “wire” days in telegraphs and telephones, to its “wave” days operating magnets, engines, radio, radar, and then to computers and finally the inner workings of the human body and brain. He manages to string the narrative along more or less seamlessly (although it all hangs together more tightly in the beginning), and explains it all in an accessible manner. (If it makes you feel better, even the people who got electricity to do something useful didn’t really know hot it worked, either)

But the scientific story takes a back seat to the colorful personalities and rivalries. The “real” story of certain innovations reads like an expose. Samuel Morse didn’t invent the telegraph - he barely understood it, but he did patent Joseph Henry’s innovation and bribe government officials to uphold his claims. Edison “had a vacuum where is conscience should be” and was thus the perfect attack dog aimed by his corporate master to exploit Alexander Graham Bell’s invention. William Shockley hogged the credit for developing the semiconductor transistor at Bell labs and set up shop in what was to become Silicon Valley.

In these not-so-admirable cases, the drive to achieve was not a passion for scientific truth. Edison was dirt-poor and on his own from an early age. Morse wanted the money and means to promulgate his views on racial superiority. Shockley, too, was such a public racist that his fellow scientists eventually kept their distance. So much for rational thought.

Prejudice of various orientations is a factor throughout many stages of narrative. The stark class views of Admiral Harris, in charge of the RAF Bomber Squadron during World War II, led logically to the horrific bombings of German civilians. The British criminalization of homosexuality and forced hormonal treatment led to the suicide of Alan Turing, who played a leading role in decoding German communcitions during WWII and is immortalized by his conception of the Turing Machine (the first formal computer model) and the Turing Test (a thought-experiment to determine whether a computer could pass as human).

Turing was one of the good guys. Despite the bad apples, there still are the inspirational characters motivated for intellectual achievement, (Faraday’s lifelong search for the link between electricity and magnetic waves), generosity (Joseph Henry spent his career teaching and sharing his knowledge), altruism (Alexander Graham Bell was devoted to helping the hearing-impaired).

And patriotism. Radar was developed first for the defense of England, but the admirable technical achievement is dwarfed by the heroism of the all-female radar operators who manned their stations while undergoing direct bombardment. In fact, if you count the female data operators managing the huge mechanical calculators (they had to ask men to leave the premises so they could disrobe in the excessively hot working conditions) and luminaries like Countess Ada Lovelace who thought up programs for Babbage’s first (but never functioning) mechanical computer and Admiral Grace Hopper’s work on the first compilers (not to mention popularizing the term “bug”), it seems that the bulk of early computer software was either written or executed by women.

If there’s anything to critize about this “story” of electricity, maybe it’s too much of a feel-good story. The author doesn’t cover some disturbing to downright nasty applications of electricity - the electric chair, electroshock therapy, and stun guns come to mind.

But maybe that’s for another book. The extended notes at the end, and the recommended reading section are worth perusing almost as books in themselves - they indicate the wealth of real-life science history out there just waiting to be read (the author is quite generous and modest in praising some works as far beyond the quality of his). Now, why don’t they use material like this in school?
