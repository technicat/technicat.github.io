<p>After a little prompting from the dimeRocker folks, I put <a href="http://apps.facebook.com/dimerocker/play/hyperbowl">HyperBowl on the dimeRocker Arcade</a>, their new game-portal-as-facebook-app. It took me only a few hours, downloading and importing the latest dimeRocker Unity package, installing the prefab, filling out the app details and uploading the build. I did that last night and found it approved (which is required for it to show up on the arcade front page as pictured below). I&rsquo;m pleased to see it loads way faster then the one I host on <a href="http://hyperbowl3d.com/">http://hyperbowl3d.com/</a></p>

<p>Next, I&rsquo;ll try integrating with the dimeRocker API. With their earlier platform (which will be discontinued in a few months), I got as far as retrieving the Facebook user name as the player name but didn&rsquo;t quite get the leaderboard working. Hopefully, I&rsquo;ll have more success this time and also get achievements working, as I intended to implement those anyway for the <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/id344209253">iPhone version of HyperBowl</a> with Game Center. Which reminds me, the optional App Store link on the dimeRocker Arcade page is a nice cross-promotional feature.</p>

<p>Eventually, I&rsquo;ll think about using the monetization features. You don&rsquo;t get ad-share revenue from the Arcade, but it does feature a virtual currency system you can use to get payments for game features, e.g. lock out certain levels, although I&rsquo;m more inclined to offer extra bowling balls for sale.</p>
