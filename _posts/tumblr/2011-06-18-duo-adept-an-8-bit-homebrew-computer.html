<p>This reminds me of my<a href="http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-004-computation-structures-spring-2009/"> 6.004 Computation Systems</a> class at MIT, in which we constructed a computer from TTL components, but in that course we were given the design and I didn&rsquo;t really understand what I was doing until after the first semester (it&rsquo;s a two-semester course). This guy added more graphics capability and wrote a lot of cool software, too:</p>



<p>Here&rsquo;s the kit I worked on, photo taken after I spent spring break tidying up all the wires. I&rsquo;m no Wozniak, but once I figured out what I was doing, this was my pride and joy.</p>
