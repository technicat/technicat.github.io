After posting a jab at CNN, I was surprised to receive a snippety comment on the post. First reaction: mild annoyance. Second reaction: gratification that for once it wasn’t spam (relatively new to blogging, I’m surprised and occasionally fooled by the automated posts, like “I like your writing…blah, blah, blah… please put me on your blogroll”). Third reaction: who’s reading this blog, and why are they reading it if they’re so offended? But I checked my web access log a while later (one annoying side effect of the blog wave - now it’s confusing to call web server access logs “web logs”, like I used to), and found I’m getting traffic from the CNN web page I linked to on my post, although I don’t bother with [trackbacks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trackback). Turns out CNN uses the blog search tool from [Sphere](http://www.sphere.com/) that finds content out there that links to your post. I was similarly surprised to see that happen when I linked to a Google blog, but it makes sense - they use Google. Like I said, I’m relatively new to this stuff (but I’ll never call myself a “newbie”. Or buy a Dummies book. Matter of principal.) Sphere looks like an interesting company. Their Jobs page asks for:

1. Great communication skills. We’re a virtual team, so frequent and clear written communication is a must.
2. Adaptability in a changing environment. Our business is changing and growing fast; self leadership is the path to success.
3. Expertise and vision. Bring something unique to the team.
and applications in the form of:
1. your resume
2. a description of what you have to offer us
3. a description of what you want to get from us
Apparently they’re a virtual company just like mine. Except for the investors (they must have paid a pretty penny for sphere.com), employees and product!
