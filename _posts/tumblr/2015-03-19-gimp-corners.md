Sure, the middleware and IDEs get all the attention: Unity, Xamarin, Unreal, Swift, Corona…but the software I use in every app is GIMP, to scale, crop, merge, touch up and deindex all those icons, screenshots, feature graphics, and launch screens. Here’s an example: iOS will round icon corners for you, but on Android you have to do it yourself if you don’t want really square looking icons. In GIMP, select the the Round Corners filter under the Decor submenu, and make sure you have a transparent background (otherwise the option is grayed out). For icon purposes, you probably want to deselect the drop shadow and fill-in background color options in the resulting dialog.
