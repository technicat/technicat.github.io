Well, I’ve already fallen behind my blog-a-day goal for the year, but I’m not too embarrassed to list all my writing targets (where I classify “writing” as any keyboard activity that doesn’t produce code):

- a blog a day
- a tweet an hour
- an app build a day
- a new app a month
- a book a year
Due to sleep and (paying) work, the tweet stat will have to be averaged, but the rest should be regular. Check with me in a year. &nbsp;
