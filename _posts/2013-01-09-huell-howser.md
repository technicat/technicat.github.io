When I first saw Huell Howser on his show California Gold, I thought his voice was going through my brain, and I couldn’t believe he could possibly be as excited as he seemed to be, talking about the local waste processing facility or whatever. But his enthusiastic sincerity grew on me, and whenever I channel-surfed onto his show, I hung around a while. In fact, I never would have visited LA’s Little Tokyo if I hadn’t seen him visit a mochi ice cream place, there. Now I make a point of staying in Little Tokyo when I’m in LA, and mochi ice cream…mmmm. Thanks, Huell.
