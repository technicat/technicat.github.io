This weekend, thanks to Daylight Savings Time, I instantly moved ahead in time one hour. After watching Lost this season, I was disappointed the experience wasn&rsquo;t accompanied by a blinding flash of light. But it did make me think of some time travel stories that have made an impression on me:
</p><ul><li>This year, of course, it&rsquo;s Lost, that somehow keeps a story that looks like it&rsquo;s going to veer out of control moving along and constantly suspenseful. The biggest mystery - did the writers plan this all along or were they making it up?</li>
	<li>A Sound of Thunder - the original Ray Bradbury story, not the movie. Gives the &ldquo;butterfly effect&rdquo; a whole new meaning.</li>
	<li>Bill and Ted&rsquo;s Excellent Adventure</li>
	<li>Timecop - when will Van Damme receive his lifetime achievement award?</li>
	<li>The Robert Heinlein story in which a man travels back in time and fathers himself</li>
	<li>The Star Trek: Deep Space Nine episode in which the crew travels back to Roswell</li>
	<li>The Star Trek: Next Generation episode in which Data&rsquo;s detached head is unearthed</li>
	<li>The Futurama episodes that riff on the previous three</li>
	<li>The Terminator</li>
	<li>The Sarah Connor Chronicles - it&rsquo;s got enough going on that it deserves to be separated from the movies</li>
</ul>
