<p>After rating a couple of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffyverse">Whedonverse</a> books on <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/">Goodreads</a>, the <a href="http://www.smartpopbooks.com/">publisher</a> asked to be my Goodreads &ldquo;friend&rdquo;. A crass Myspace-like practice - the <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1046473">SmartPop profile</a> lists all their own books and gives top five stars. To top it off, I just found in my Goodreads inbox a note from them inviting me to read their other offerings. Fortunately, Goodreads makes it easy to block a member and flag its messages.</p>

<p>For a publisher of cool, esoteric books, they have pretty lame marketing. I&rsquo;d already planned to read their books - now I&rsquo;m inclined to avoid them.</p>
