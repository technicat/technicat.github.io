Since I recently joined [Goodreads](http://www.goodreads.com/ "Goodreads") I’ve been going nuts on that site - not the thousands of books some members have listed, but I have added nearly two hundred books. In contrast, on [Epinions](http://www.epinions.com/ "Epinions"), where I first started writing online reviews several years ago, I’ve lately only contributed reviews out of a sense of obligation. What’s so different between the two?<!--more-->

Well, Goodreads started as a programmer’s project to track his own reading list (at least I think that was Goodreads - possibly it’s a competitor site) But anyway, it sure feels like that - it is ridiculously easy to find, add and rate a book. The bottleneck there is doing the book search (and there they cover their bases - if the book isn’t in the Goodreads database, it goes through an Amazon database). Rating/adding to your list is just one click and there is good web design and use of popups to make it obvious. Reviewing and categorizing takes a bit more effort, but I’ve found after a hundred books or so, I feel guilty if I don’t.

Epinions, like Goodreads, lets you keep ownership of the review (although that is made more explicit in the Epinions user agreement). I was under the impression that Epinions did not reserve the right to alter your review (I heard one Epinion user complain how Amazon edited one of her book reviews), but it seems the current Epinions user agreement allows that. Epinions pays “eroyalties” (I got $13 last year, which prompted me to write a couple more reviews). But the writing is more of a burden - you have to write something (a while ago they introduced Express Reviews which can be short, but if you know that an extra hundred words or so will qualify for eroyalties, you feel you have to do it), the community of book reviewers can be pretty snobby and annoying when commenting on your reviews (other groups like movie and hotel reviewers are more laid back), and the writing process is more tedious - no quick preview, a lot of web page traversal involved if you’re editing online. And they used to perform maintenance on Sunday afternoons (who’s on the web then?) during which any in-progress content would be lost (that seems to have improved after eBay acquired Shopping.com, which had acquired Epinions)

But the final straw for me now - I’m taking a look at all the indemnification clauses in my various online accounts, and while Goodreads has a straightforward one that specifies indemnification in the event of a violation of the user agreement, Epinions has one of those regrettably common ones that state you will indemnify them for any legal action relating to your use of the service. Enforceable or not, no one should have to agree to that (same problem with Google Adsense, which I’ve just stopped using, and Registernames.com - started switching over to Dreamhost, which has a sloppily-worded but still reasonably narrow indemnifation clause.) Just say no!
