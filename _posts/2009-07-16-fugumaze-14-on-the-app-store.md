The release of iPhone OS 3.0 has prompted an update of my iPhone apps. There have been reports of long approval periods during the OS release, but this [FuguMaze update](http://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=295808255&mt=8) approval came in at just about a week. The latest version of the Unity engine fixes a compressed audio issue with OS 3.0, which is a good thing since I decided to compress the suspense sounds in this version and build with byte-code stripping to reduce the file size (now around 10MB). I probably negated that by throwing in some alternate skybox textures, though.
