<p>Well, once again I gave Google AdSense a try, and once again, I decided to drop it. The experiment was somewhat illuminating, although based on a small sample size, just a few days. Not surprisingly, I got more impressions from my <a href="http://technicat.com/">Technicat</a> site, which I know garners the most traffic, but the <a href="http://hyperbowl3d.com/">HyperBowl</a> site generates the most click-throughs.

Looking at the ads served on those sites, I can see why - most of the  ads that showed up on hyperbowl3d.com, which hosts a web-based bowling  game, were about other bowling games, while technicat.com mostly listed  continuing or online education courses. Snooze.

Nevertheless, it&rsquo;s  small change, there are some annoying looking ads (a big gaudy vertical  banner touting Orange County coupons?), and I just noticed something I didn&rsquo;t like in the program policies - check out the last line in this partial listing:

Sites with Google ads may not include or link to:
<ul><li>Pornography, adult or mature content</li>
	<li>Violent content</li>
	<li>Content related to racial intolerance or advocacy against any individual, group or organisation</li>
</ul>
I think it&rsquo;s poorly worded. Can I speak out against racial intolerance? And I reserve the right to advocate against any organization (Fox News, Microsoft, MoveOn, city hall&hellip;) or individual (CNN anchors, for example). The policy prohibits not just including such content but linking to such content. Guess I&rsquo;ll remove those links to&hellip;everything.

Actually, the first two lines are pretty dubious, too. No &ldquo;adult&rdquo; or &ldquo;mature&rdquo; content? What does that cover? Nudity? And &ldquo;violent&rdquo; content? I can&rsquo;t link to a boxing site? Or review the latest PS3 shooter?

Obviously, with all the Google Ads showing up on blogs, this is not an  enforced policy, and I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s well-intentioned (or at least cautious in a don&rsquo;t-get-us-sued sense), but it reads like something that might have leaked over  from their China compromise.
