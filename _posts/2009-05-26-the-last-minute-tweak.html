<p>As I rewatched <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0185906/">Band of Brothers</a> this weekend, once again I just couldn&rsquo;t believe that just before the paratroopers took off for the D-Day invasion, they were given new 80-pound bags to strap on their legs that they had never trained with. A last-minute inspiration from HQ that would supposedly provide them with more equipment and weaponry when they landed. As you might expect from a last-minute untested idea, it didn&rsquo;t work well - after lugging around that extra weight, much of it was lost during the jumps, anyway.</p>

<p>This can&rsquo;t-leave-well-enough-alone is common in software projects, too, although of course with less drastic consequences. Software is just too easy to change, and most people view what programmers do as &ldquo;magic&rdquo;. Abracadabra! On many projects I&rsquo;ve suggested or argued for a slowdown, in fact micromanagement, of changes as a product approaches release, but in practice that&rsquo;s mostly resulted in a bunch of meetings before release in which every idea for a change was approved. One company that made a big deal about process (ISO 9000 and all that) was proud of having hardcopy change orders that needed sign-offs, but those changes involved whole feature sets! A manager at another company didn&rsquo;t even bother to pretend to understand - everyone would cram in as many changes as possible into a milestone release, the publisher would receive something severely buggy or crashing, the manager would throw a fit about why people couldn&rsquo;t be more careful, and then when I proposed a &ldquo;freeze&rdquo; before release, she&rsquo;d complain, &ldquo;but then we can&rsquo;t change anything&rdquo;. Duh. It&rsquo;s called risk management. If you could really throw in stuff without testing and get away with it, we wouldn&rsquo;t need all these alpha and beta releases, or a QA staff, for that matter.</p>

<p>The last-minute tweak. Just don&rsquo;t do it.</p>
