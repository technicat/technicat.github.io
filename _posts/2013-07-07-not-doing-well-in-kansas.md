Amazon’s [Author Central](http://authorcentral.amazon.com/) is pretty cool. Not only does it allow you to ensure your books on Amazon point to an author profile listing your books, blog, etc., it also provides sales statistics on your print books. Sorry, no ebooks, and not even all print sales (only participating retailers who provide data), but it does come with this neat geographic display. Based on the sales of my [Unity book](http://learnunity4.com/) (admittedly, a small sample size), seems like there’s a dearth of game developers in Kansas, Idaho and Colorado.
