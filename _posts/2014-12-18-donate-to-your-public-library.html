<p>One way to promote your book, donate a copy to your public library. I checked out the San Mateo Public Library earlier this year, which by the way is fantastic and has the best computer section I&rsquo;ve ever seen in a public library, and asked if they&rsquo;d be interested in stocking a copy of my book. The guy said, sure, why not, which was more encouraging than the person at the Huntington Beach Public Library who said they might put it in the book sale, and worlds better than the Jersey City library who said they don&rsquo;t take book donations (one more in a list of my grievances against New Jersey - stay tuned for a long blog). I&rsquo;m guessing that book is the one listed here as checked out:</p>
