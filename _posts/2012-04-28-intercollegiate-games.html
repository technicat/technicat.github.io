I checked out the Intercollegiate Game Showcase taking place at Chapman University, today. I was impressed by the students&rsquo; work - with the exception of one team that unfortunately couldn&rsquo;t get their demo running with the projector (I can relate - I once flew across the country to a trade show and for a while thought I wouldn&rsquo;t be able to get the booth demo running at all for the show), the games were in running condition and looked polished. I sort of viewed them like gamasutra postmortems - it&rsquo;s interesting to me that the teams ranged from 3-6 members, women were pretty well represented (and not just in art), programmers constituted the plurality if not majority of each team, and even students get carried away with titles (do you need to call yourself a Creative Director if you&rsquo;re the only artist? And does a team of four really need a dedicated Project Manager?)</p>

<p>One tech note of interest - one team had a 2D game but used a 3D engine for its numerical precision in implementing their game&rsquo;s spinning-cog mechanics (I wonder what engine they used?) That was also the most polished and innovative-looking game.</p>

<p>I only stayed for the first hour, though, largely because I skipped lunch and my stomach was grumbling, but also because I was getting bored with the judges. The panel had a high pedigree, and they had good practical and sympathetic advice for the team that couldn&rsquo;t get their demo running with the projector (always have a video as a backup), but I don&rsquo;t think the students need to hear things like look at Angry Birds, marketing is really really important, and you can&rsquo;t compete in this genre. There&rsquo;s time enough for that when it comes time to deal with publishers.</p>
