I’m trying out yet another Android appstore, this one for the[Nabi tablet](http://nabitablet.com/) (the folks at Zeemote pointed me to it). [HyperBowl](http://hyperbowl3d.com/) is now there, so let’s see how that goes. Once again, this [appstore](http://fuguhapps.com/) is fairly new so not ridiculously crowded, but there are some corresponding glitches in getting apps on there, too (e.g. it keeps complaining about a missing version code when I try uploading Fugu Maze, which is baffling). In fact, the software looks like it’s been repurpuposed from some other phone app storefront, since it requires you to load screenshots that are not only lower-res, but different aspect ratios from the Nabi! The device itself is really nice, though - a modern Tegra3 tablet for $200, and they did a nice job on the on the interface. Actually, two interfaces, the kids’ mode and the mommy/daddy mode. Now, we’ll just have to see if people will buy apps on it (or if I can figure out how to ads properly on a kid device, or, shudder!, actually get around to implementing in-app purchases).
