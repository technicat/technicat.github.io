<p>It&rsquo;s not easy to make money off books (I read that JK Rowling&rsquo;s new book sold only 1500 copies since April, before it was revealed she&rsquo;s the author, and the ebook for Shutter Island sells a handful a day). But self-publishing books is fun and painless compared to apps. The online tools are getting better. Barnes and Noble&rsquo;s nookpress site now lets you edit your manuscript online, even allowing collaborators and commenters. And the Kindle Direct Publishing site has a Cover Creator for designing book covers. You can start with stock graphics in a variety of styles:</p>

<p><a href="http://itshardtofondlepenguins.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Screen-Shot-2013-07-13-at-8.00.26-PM.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6232" alt="Screen Shot 2013-07-13 at 8.00.26 PM" src="http://itshardtofondlepenguins.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Screen-Shot-2013-07-13-at-8.00.26-PM.png" width="1054" height="485"/></a></p>

<p>Or upload your own graphic and apply those styles. I think my final result looks pretty good:</p>
