<p>An updated <a href="http://www.apple.com/downloads/dashboard/games/hyperbowlclassic.html">HyperBowl Mac widget</a> is now on the web site - submitted it Monday, saw it there on Tuesday! (quite a difference from the App Store review time) Didn&rsquo;t get Feature Widget status this time, but still a Staff Favorite and hanging in the <a href="http://www.apple.com/downloads/dashboard/top50/">Top 50</a> download list. So, no complaints. This update fixes a crash/freeze that occurs if you get a spare in the ninth frame (an embarrassing code bug) and has a new trophy scene as shown below.</p>

<p>Under the hood, it&rsquo;s a rather substantial rework - the previous version had assets imported at 1/100 of the proper scale (due to a default import scaling option in Unity), so I scaled down physics to match, which is supposed to work. But it doesn&rsquo;t. When I reimported everything without the shrinkage and leaving physics parameters alone, the bowling pins behave much better. In particular, they don&rsquo;t get stuck in a partial fall/roll and just stand there tilting. Plus I added a flat collider to the bottom of the pins so they can wobble a bit if they just get a glancing blow. Seems to me even the lighting works a bit better and the materials automatically pick up the right textures when I reimported (as opposed to manually attaching each one the first time I did it) Lesson learned - from now on when I&rsquo;m importing assets, I&rsquo;ll be sure to reimport them immediately at the desired scale. Now, anxiously awaiting the new iPhone version to show up on the App Store&hellip;</p>
