_Originally written on Epinions in June 2004:_

**Out of Time** looks like it wants to be **Body Heat** meets **No Way Out**. Denzel Washington gamely plays the police chief of a small Florida town near Miami who’s fooling around with a married woman and then finds himself the most likely suspect in a double-murder. So he has to stay one step ahead of the authorities, led by his soon-to-be-divorced wife, to find out what really happened and clear his name.

Despite the humid scenery, the result is tepid. The entire movie revolves around Denzel, as each of the other major players engage in a contest to see who has less chemistry with him. When Chief Whitlock is not engaged in unexciting foreplay with the married Ann Harrison, he’s exchanging glares with Chris Harrison, the man he’s cuckolding, or bickering with his almost-ex-wife Alex. Then there’s the requisite buddy figure, the forensic examiner who wanders around like he’s looking for a sandwich.

There’s some mild suspense as Denzel is seemingly trapped in this corner and that, but it’s hard to believe at any point that he’s not going to get out of it. And the plot twists I waited for…didn’t happen. Well, I did predict one predictable twist, and it turned out I had to settle for a different predictable twist (I liked mine better), followed by a silly feel-good ending. But I did appreciate the savvy use of cell phones, which does update this genre.

Eva Mendes is striking as Chief Whitlock’s wife and believable as a newly-promoted detective, but Sanaa Lathan doesn’t exhibit that something in her femme fatale character that could drag Whitlock down into so much trouble (she’s no Kathleen Turner), and Dean Cain as her abusive husband doesn’t seem scary or mean enough for his role, despite his football-player physique and “caged lion” acting. To be fair, the actors are impaired by uninspired dialogue. (“I’m coming”, says Whitlock on the phone to department HQ, as he’s fumbling around with Harrison. I mean, really.)

The warm Florida visuals (only marred by obviously fake night fog) and Denzel’s smooth and steady performance make this movie palatable. Besides the director’s commentary, the special features includes some cast interviews and making-of featurettes. The cool thing about DVD’s is that you can wrap interesting movie-making information around an uninteresting movie, and **Out of Time** needs the help.
