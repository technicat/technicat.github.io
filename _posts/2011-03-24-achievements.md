In my last round of iPhone/iPad updates, I added Game Center achievements, using the plugin from[Prime31 Studios](http://prime31.com/).

For [Fugu Maze](http://itunes.apple.com/app/fugu-maze/id295808255?mt=8), I just have an achievement for completing the maze and scrambling the maze. I should add one for customizing the maze (with your own photo as a texture).

In [Fugu Bowl](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/fugubowl/id297032758?mt=8), you get an achievement for a spare or a strike.

For [HyperBowl](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/hyperbowl/id344209253?mt=8), I added a bunch of scoring achievements, inspired by a suggestion from a HyperBowl fan, Ischa Bijl, that I unlock bonus levels for bowling doubles, triples, turkeys, etc. Eventually, I plan to add some lane-specific achievements, like hit the fire hydrant in the San Francisco lane, or knock over all the vases in the Rome lane.
