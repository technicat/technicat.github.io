I went into the advertising business last week, on the web and on the iPhone. Here are my iAds results for the last three days for [Fugu Bowl](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/fugu-bowl/id297032758?mt=8):

and Google Adsense results for the same three days:

I’m not getting mortage-paying numbers for either platform (or even lunch-paying numbers), but so far iAds is the superior performer (and just on one app). On the other hand, the Google Ad revenue from my [HyperBowl](http://hyperbowl3d.com/) site beats what I’m getting from the game portals I’ve deployed it on. But my app sales are still beating my ad revenue, so I won’t be switching entirely to an ad-based revenue model…yet.
