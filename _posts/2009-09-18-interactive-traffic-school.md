I’m a free man!

> Dear Philip, Your traffic school Certificate of Completion has been processed by the court and your case has been dismissed. Sincerely, Court Official West Justice Center Orange County, California

My “case” took a while (it was for not stopping at a stop sign - maybe it was a Bostonian rolling stop, but the officer described it as if I’d just cruised on through. I’d like to see the evidence. When is Google going to have real-time satellite traffic videos?) When I first tried to pay my traffic ticket at the courthouse, they told me “you’re not in the computer”, giving rise to thoughts of a Catch-22 situation where I couldn’t pay my ticket but got in trouble for not paying my ticket (anyone see the movie Brazil?) This wasn’t helped by the web-site instructions saying I should follow the instructions on the ticket on the “courtesy notice” which hadn’t arrived since I wasn’t in the computer, while the ticket itself said I was responsible for following the instructions on the courtesy notice but the courtesy notice was just a courtesy so I might not receive one. But thankfully(?) I received a letter a month later saying the citing officer mad a “mistake” and my case was “rescheduled” and a month after that I received a letter with instructions on selecting a traffic school. In the same envelope was another note instructing me not to select a traffic school for another two weeks because they just changed traffic school systems, and, here’s the good part, a modest refund. I’m mildly curious about the in-person schools that employ comedians as instructors - thought that was a made-up idea in King of the Hill - but not that curious. Instead, I decided to make the most of the situation by trying out an online traffic school that featured Flash games, [Traffic Interactive](http://trafficinteractive.com/). The games are OK, about par for free Flash games. While you might expect a bunch of driving simulations, there’s only one driving minigame in the section about choosing the correct lane: ![Picture 6](http://itshardtofondlepenguins.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/Picture-6-300x191.png "Picture 6")Most of the games have nothing to do with driving, e.g. the one below requires you to harpoon squid - you just score a few points and the game pauses while a popup explains a few driving rules. ![Picture 7](http://itshardtofondlepenguins.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/Picture-7.png "Picture 7")I don’t even remember what this one is: ![Picture 8](http://itshardtofondlepenguins.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/Picture-8.png "Picture 8")Most of the game is filled with non-interactive Flash presentations that border on annoying (actually, they cross the border a few times - I mean, why does that guy keep harping on his grandma’s driving? They should show teenagers - they’re the worst) And it’s still traffic school - games or no games, after a few hours, it feels like it’s not going to end. Fortunately, there is a nice map showing your progress in this traffic school wonderland: ![Picture 1](http://itshardtofondlepenguins.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/Picture-1-300x203.png "Picture 1")And the beauty of an online school is you can log out and log in at anytime. I killed an afternoon completing the bulk of the course but had trouble logging into the final test (which requires additional authentication steps). It took me days before I figured out (there appears to be no functioning help desk) that the pull-down list of courts in the final test login had my court listed twice, once as “Online” and once as “Notary”, which “Notary” listed further down and I had selected that inadvertently. The web design isn’t great. On the other hand, the online school cost around $15 and the online authenticated final test (vs. the Notary option which requires you to pay a notary to watch you take it) costs an additional $8. So I finally took the test near midnight during&nbsp; a commercial break while watching Conan. You can’t beat that for convenience.
