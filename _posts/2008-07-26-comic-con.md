Just got back from my first [Comic-Con](http://www.comic-con.org/). Although there’s a huge and packed exhibit hall (even for the one Thursday I was there, which I assume is the least busy day), it doesn’t feel like a commercial show - it’s all about the fans. In a typical trade show, even E3 and the Tokyo Game Show, three hours and I’ve had enough. I managed to kill eight hours at Comic-Con and could have hung around longer (presentations and films continue until midnight), but the sun was going down and I was wearing shades.

I started off by walking through the exhibit hall, went to the new Battlestar Galactica panel moderated by Richard Hatch, caught the end of a presentation by Will Wright (on his new game Spore, but he was showing slides of Werner Von Braun when I walked in), saw a cast member of Heroes surrounded by a small mob, walked through the exhibits again, loitering mostly around the artists autograph tables, went back upstairs and caught a couple of anime shows, watched a few screenings of indie short films with Q&A of the filmmakers, walked through the autograph signing booths and got an autograph (and friendly chat) from Lt. Boomer of the original BSG, back down to the exhibit hall, started to leave as it got increasingly crowded, decided to go back for another pass, realized I missed a whole section, bought a [Storm Bringers](http://www.stormbringers.com/) comic, started to leave again, came back for another pass, realized there was still at least a third of the exhibit I hadn’t seen, bought three books from [Design Studio Press](http://designstudiopress.com/), saw Robert Culp in animated discussion with a fan, chatted at various booths for the indie game [Cyborg Mice](http://cyborgmice.com/), the geek-themed social network [MyNerdGirl](http://mynerdgirl.com/) and some self-published comic book authors, got farther out the door but decided to step in the last hall I hadn’t visited and caught the end of a Q&A with Jeremy Piven and other cast of the movie Rock and Roll, was rewarded for staying that long with a ticket stub and spent another half hour waiting to pick up the free t-shirt. A great deal for $25.
