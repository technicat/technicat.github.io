I’ve heard that South Korea has great broadband speed, especially compared to the US, and that’s been my experience from my one trip to Korea that I just returned from. Here’s the Speedtest result from my hotel near the Incheon airport. Check out that upload speed!

The results from my hotel near the San Francisco airport don’t look that much worse, as long as you’re just downloading. But uploading sucks (as I just verified with an app submission).

But both cases are way better than Hong Kong.
