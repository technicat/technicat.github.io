When my sister told me I should work on [iPhone](http://www.apple.com/iphone/) games, I finally got off my duff and applied to the [Apple Developer Program](//developer.apple.com/iphone/program/). Three months later, I’m in. Apparently, there’s a longer vetting process if you apply as a company rather than an individual developer, but the timing is not bad - the [Unity engine for iPhone](http://unity3d.com/unity/features/iphone-publishing) is due to be released next week, and I’ve got a pipeline of projects ready to go.

To celebrate, I threw out several years worth of mobile phone development documentation.&nbsp; [J2ME](http://java.sun.com/javame/index.jsp)programming is mostly straightforward, except everyone has their own SDK, always on Windows, never on the Mac, even though the Mac is a fine Java development environment (I ended up building all my J2ME apps on my Mac with [mpowerplayer](http://mpowerplayer.com/), also using it to showcase the resulting midlets on the web, as with the [Digimana games](http://www.fugugames.com/mobilegames.html)). Testing on a local device doesn’t require a program membership and accompaning $99 fee (or $199 for corporate deployment) as in the iPhone program…if you can find a cable. Of the two phones I used for J2ME testing, I found one data cable in a T-mobile store, and for the other I drove to a specialty store in Irvine, where the proprietor scavenged a cable from a similar model.

But the biggest problem with J2ME was the publishing. I started with a Nextel [Motorola i85s](http://www.arcx.com/sites/Motorolai85.htm) that disconcertingly invoked a static noise from any nearby speaker that had MIDP 1.0 and just enough memory and display for simple black-and-white games, and the Motorola-run [IDEN](http://idenphones.motorola.com/iden/) network for publishing apps. A J2ME programmer at the [Orange County Java Users group](http://ocjug.org/) informed me that Motorola wasn’t all that interested in games, but I wasn’t all that interested in paying the thousand-dollar or so submission fee, either. (that $99 for Apple doesn’t sound so bad, anymore!)

So after testing my usual Othello program on the phone, with just enough room left over for a calculator program, I left it alone until I switched to T-Mobile and the [Sony-Ericsson T610](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sony_Ericsson_T610), advertised to include MIDP 2.0, a color display, and downloadable games via&nbsp; t-zones. I saw t-zones, saw no way to download games, returned to the T-Mobile store to watch the sales reps fiddle with my phone and conclude “yeah, there’s no way to download games on this model”.

In the meantime, I saw J2ME pre-installed on the slick [Palm V](http://www.palm.com/us/support/palm5/)’s (the last good-looking Palm) sold at a special price during Java One (where a Sun employee asked to cut in front of me to get around the daily quota) and then watched Palm decline as part of 3com, watched [Handango](http://handango.com/) announce a publishing program for J2ME apps then abandon it (at least for phones - they seem to support Palm and Rim), finally upgrade from my otherwise excellent T610 to a [Blackberry Pearl](http://www.blackberry.com/blackberrypearl/) to find that no only did the syncing not run on my Mac, it didn’t run on Vista. And I kept rationalizing, there’s a glut of 2D phone games (it seems to me there’s one perfect 2D cell phone game - [Sudoku](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudoku)) - so I’ll wait for 3D on cell phones. But mophun is gone, I don’t know what happened to Superscape, I’ve seen one [M3G](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_3D_Graphics_API) phone, which I think cost a friend of mine $300, and I only heard of [OpenGL ES](http://www.khronos.org/opengles/) running on one or a few Nokia phones that I’ve never seen in a store.

But now there’s the iPhone (or iTouch), which actually does have OpenGL ES. And I can develop on my Mac. Using the same development tools used for [my desktop and web games](http://www.fugugames.com/). And self-publish (given Apple approval) on the [App Store](http://www.apple.com/iphone/appstore/). Yep, that’s how I planned it all along!
