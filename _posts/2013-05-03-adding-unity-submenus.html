<p>This Â is probably one of those things that everyone else knows and I only just figured out, but I&rsquo;ve been wondering how to take my Editor-scripted HyperBowl menu items and put them in a submenu of my FuguGames menu (menu bar space is scarce). Turns out it&rsquo;s just a matter of treating the menu name like a pathname. For example, where before I just specified &ldquo;HyperBowl/Tokyo&rdquo; to add a Tokyo item to the HyperBowl menu (to configure the Player Settings for a HyperBowl Tokyo build), now it&rsquo;s &ldquo;FuguGames/HyperBowl/Tokyo&rdquo; to place it in a HyperBowl submenu of the FuguGames menu.<br/><code><br/>
[MenuItem ("FuguGames/HyperBowl/Tokyo")]<br/>
static void Tokyo() {<br/>
PlayerSettings.productName = "HyperBowl Tokyo";<br/>
PlayerSettings.bundleIdentifier = "com.technicat.HyperTokyo";<br/>
PlayerSettings.SetScriptingDefineSymbolsForGroup(BuildTargetGroup.iPhone,"HYPERTOKYO;"+freeDefs);<br/>
UseIcon ("tokyo.png");<br/>
}<br/></code></p>
