<p>While was waiting for iTunesConnect to reopen for business, I thought abou what I accomplished, app-wise, this year.</p>

<p>I got the HyperBowl Tokyo lane running last December, so this is the first year I&rsquo;ve had the full set of original <a href="http://hyperbowl3d.com/">HyperBowl</a> lanes. In January, I turned my attention to the fairly new Mac App Store and was sorely disappointed. It took a couple of months to get a rejection on my HyperBowl submission, and then another, and then another, and upon appeal, the board said it had been &ldquo;repurposed&rdquo; too much and I should &ldquo;start from the ground up&rdquo;. In the meantime, I got Fugu Maze accepted, no problem, so maybe I&rsquo;ll make back my annual developer fee. But I plan to let my Mac App Store developer membership expire next month. After getting a rejection from Steam (which has a policy of not telling you why they rejected it), and negligible returns from ad-based web portals like Kongregate and Gamejolt, I think it&rsquo;s a much better use of time to focus on mobile.</p>

<p>However, the Mac app version of HyperBowl did force me to add a decent-looking pause menu - I wavered between GUIKit001 and EZGUI and went with the former because it looked like the fastest way to get going. I updated the iOS version of HyperBowl with it, and in the process added a bug - since I added a collider for one of the HUD elements to facilitate tap-to-pause, that collider also existed in world space as an invisible barrier that could block your bowling (but it was super-thin like a supermodel so you could bowl through it if you rolled fast enough!) Using the new collision layers in Unity fixed it, but I delayed implementing the fix for quite a while, first because I got enmeshed in the next Unity beta and then because of the crash issues with Unity and a new version of XCode. Eventually, I just had to roll back to an older version of XCode. During that period, I think I lost some sales momentum.</p>

<p>In thatÂ  period, I stopped issuing single-lane versions of HyperBowl, due to the bugs mentioned above but also because Apple called me to ask why I had so many versions of HyperBowl - HyperBowl proper plus the first three lanes, and I had High Seas in submission. They really wanted me to use in-app purchasing, but they said they would let it go since I only had six lanes total. Annoyed, I decided forget it, it&rsquo;s too much trouble - the indvidual lanes were free, anyway.</p>

<p>But I changed my mind later in the summer, when I realized I was getting some non-negligible iAd revenue from Fugu Bowl. And the Lodsys activity was at its peak, so it seemed like a good time as any to introduce new &ldquo;lite&rdquo; apps as an alternative to in-app purchases. So I cranked the remaining individual lanes and added iAds to all of them. That was a good move - I got back up to my previous revenue totals, now mostly from iAds!</p>

<p>I also added <a href="http://www.thinkgeek.com/electronics/retro-gaming/e762/">iCade</a> support to HyperBowl (I seem to be on track to incorporate all of the <a href="http://prime31.com/">prime31</a> plugins). I doubt my recent sales surge had much to do with that, but it is cool.</p>

<p>I also got a revenue boost from Android. Not so much from the Android Market - sales are meager and AdMob payments are pathetic, but I seem to have jumped on the Barnes and Noble bandwagon at the right time, getting prompt approval for my developer application and app submissions. I didn&rsquo;t like the looks of the Amazon appstore developer agreement, but I joined them to avoid missing out on the Kindle Fire. As it turns out, all my apps have been rejected for the Fire but I&rsquo;m starting to get decent sales on their appstore.</p>

<p>As soon as they pay me enough to buy a Fire, I might just get one and figure out what&rsquo;s going on with those rejections.</p>
