I’m beginning to think that Unity middleware is a good business. (or since Unity is already middleware, this would be middle-middleware?) So far I’ve purchased the [iPhone Enhancement Pack](http://stinkbot.com/) for iOS 3.x, and for iOS 4.x I’ve already bought three of the plugins offered by [Prime31](http://prime31.com/). Now I’m looking at [GUIKit001](http://gameassets.net/) - it’s a bit more than I want to pay right now, and I’m not sure it’s a match for what I need (HyperBowl already has its own level selection system, for example), but it does look good and addresses one issue I have with the UnityGUI system, which is that it doesn’t automatically handle different screen resolutions. And I do have one App Store review complaining that I don’t have a Settings menu (nothing about what exactly they want in it), so…maybe…
