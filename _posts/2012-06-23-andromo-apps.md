I was playing around with Andromo last week, before they switch to their paid subscription model. It does have an advantage over AppMakr in having support for links to web pages, Facebook pages and maps, and also AdMob. So I cranked out a few apps, [Unity News](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.andromo.dev85709.app88645), [Technicat News](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.andromo.dev85709.app87317), and [La Baguette News](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.andromo.dev85709.app87930) (yes, Iâ€™m not tops in the original title department)
