After making that little YouTube video for Fugu Dance I thought I should catch up on making videos for my other apps, especially since Google Play lets you specify a video for each app description. So here’s Fugu Bowl. In the process, I was also presented with YouTube’s new monetization option, which involves agreeing to a gigantic TOS (what did I just agree to?), assigning an AdSense account (so far I’ve got $50 in revenue from web ads - once it reaches $100 I’ll actually get paid!), and then ads will now popup on my videos (they can be turned off individually). It is kind of annoying to see those ads pop up, but on the other hand, they are easy to remove while viewing, which is more than you can say for other ads.
