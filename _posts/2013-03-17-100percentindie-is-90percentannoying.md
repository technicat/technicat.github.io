I suppose that it’s a sign of my maturation as an indie developer that I’ve gone from I’ll talk to anyone and try anything to don’t bother me, I’m working. I blame this mostly on the plethora of mobile ad providers that send me form letters asking me for a phone meeting or skype chat. But it’s not just ad providers - handster (now the Opera App Store) was an irritant, regaling me with tales of big opportunities in successively uninformative emails, until I told them I was already on their app store. That’s what self-publishing apps should come down to - uploading the app.

So that’s what I told the rep from 100percentindie.com. Actually, that’s what I told him a few emails after I got a form letter sent to the contact email I have registered for my domain (that’s a good start - mass mailing like domain reselling hucksters), not even mentioning my company name or games (the email started with time-honored impersonal greeting “Hi”, just a step above “To whom it may concern”). It wasn’t enough to get me to call the guy, but it was enough for me to check out the 100percentindie site, see that it was Chillingo and Samsung (what could go wrong?) and register on it (there was nothing else to do on the site).

After which I got an email to confirm, and then another email from another rep, which again showed no research done on my company or games but did have a Next Steps description which listed some general and typical requirements (can’t link to another app store besides Samsung). The Next Steps didn’t actually list any next steps, like how to submit an app. The email just ended with a cheery “let us know if we can help you submit an app”. Or you could just tell me now.

Which brings us back to what I said after the second email from the rep, saying they hadn’t received a reply from me. The email went on to tout the whole 100 percent revenue and self-publishing aspect, and ramped up the peppiness with “Are you in”. That’s when I replied that I was interested initially, but this sequence of uninformative sales-pitchy emails was draining the enthusiasm out of me. If it was another app store, I would have uploaded the app by now.

That’s when I finally received a human reply, with one of those non-apology apologies (“sorry if you felt that…”), saying they were waiting for my reply before giving more information, and then finally saying that what I needed to do was email then an apk for their evaluation, and then I might get an invite code to submit the app to Samsung. Hurry, we’re going live March 4. I said forget it, then he said, no problem, you can join after March 4 (actually, he said September 4, but I assume that was a mistake).

I say that third reply was a human reply, because I only realized the second email was a canned email after I received the same email from the first rep who mass mailed me. And then he sent me a third email, which I now assume was canned, also, that actually did mention the apk’s have to be emailed to them for vetting (so apparently the formula is don’t divulge useful info until the third email), and such gems “Before you do anything with Samsung, contact us” (now I really want to contact Samsung first) and “If you are not interested, please reply to this e-mail, so I can’t stop sending you e-mails” (somehow both impersonal and stalkerish).

And now that the site has information on it, if you scroll to the bottom of the About page, it turns out the 100 percent revenue they constantly tout is only for the six months after the launch (it switches to 90 percent, then later to 80 percent, then later to 70 percent), a detail not mentioned in any of the eight emails from the reps. Unless they mean you get 100 percent if you register within six months after the launch. I’m not 100 percent sure. So now I’m wondering, are they going to rename the site to 90percentindie.com in six months? And has the term “indie” been abused enough we should just kill it?
