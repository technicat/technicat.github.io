Catching up on trying out all the free stuff I downloaded from the Unity Asset Store, the latest experiment is with the Skeleton Pack. It’s a pretty good-looking skeleton, and it’s got a nice dance animation, among others, so I repurposed the Android version of my [Elektra Dance](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.technicat.ElektraDance) app and created a [Fugu Dance](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.technicat.fugudance) app. I thought about calling it Skeleton Dance, but there are plenty of other apps with something like that name - also considered Dancing Bones, but I want to hold open the possibility of adding more non-skeletal characters.
