<p>More normal approach to non-critical Unity bugs is wait a few months for someone else to report them, and then go ahead and report them while I&rsquo;m procrastinating on other things. Case in point, I just submitted a bug report that the following code in an initially active object does not mute a sound that that is active and has PlayOnAwake selected.</p>

<p><code>function Start() {<br/>
AudioListener.pause = true;<br/>
}</code></p>

<p>I noticed this a while back with the pause menu that I have on the wiki/assetstore/github - sound is muted when the menu is brought up mid-game but not if its up at the beginning (in particular, the soundtrack or ambient sound). The workaround is simple - wait a frame:</p>

<p><code>function Start() {<br/>
yield;<br/>
AudioListener.pause = true;<br/>
}</code></p>

<p>or wait for the fix.</p>
