<p>I found something new during my latest visit to Portland, a cool arcade named Ground Kontrol. It&rsquo;s like an indie Dave and Buster&rsquo;s, with arcade games, pinball machines, and a section where they serve food that&rsquo;s not very good for you. If you happen to drop in, check out the bathroom - it&rsquo;s got a neon-lined sink and Pacman tile patterns on the floor.</p>
