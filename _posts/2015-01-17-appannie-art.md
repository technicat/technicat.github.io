If I ignore the numbers, my AppAnnie stats are kind of pretty. The weekly graphs always look OK. At least, they have pretty colors, like these latest from the App Store:

Longer timelines smooth out the curves, but on the App Store, an occasional spike surrounded by not-much-interesting-happening-here results in a pretty flat graph. Unfortunately, Iâ€™m missing the first few months of my App Store history, otherwise there would be at least one more spike, right in the beginning.

I get cooler-looking results on Google Play for some reason. Like that mysterious non-a-peak-but-a-mesa! Or maybe the mystery is what happened before and after.
