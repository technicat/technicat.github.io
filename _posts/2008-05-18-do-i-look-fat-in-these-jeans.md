While making a purchase at [Borders](http://www.borders.com/), today, the cashier asked me “How would you rate our customer service, on a scale of 1 to 5?” I asked if that included the bathroom <!--more-->- I think the customer service is pretty good (generally you seem to get cool people working bookstores), but the bathroom reminds me of a gas station - it’s a mess and requires tokens to enter. And thus I gave her a rating of 5, and she looked offended.

So now I’m going to wonder if there will be an awkward situation every time I shop at Borders, or maybe I’ll just lie and give them a high rating every time. That’s what happened with [Expo](http://www.expo.com/), after they more or less completed my bathroom remodel - they gave me a survey to fill out right in front of them, and I gave them a higher score than if I’d been left to my own devices.

If you’re serious about getting customer feedback, you must take pains to get accurate data - not only be willing to hear bad news but make sure you get it. I noticed Borders has been handing out customer survey numbers on their receipts and rewarding callers with coupons, but the discount is usually less than the regular coupons they email me every week, so who’s going to bother? Worthy intentions, half-hearted execution.
