<p>For a while, I was getting daily spam (which sounds delicious if it was the real Hormel stuff) about buying a domain. That domain was registered at Moniker in Portland, OR, which just gave me an auto-reply when I sent in a complaint to their support email (I guess they don&rsquo;t want unsolicited email). Surprisingly, the unsubscribe link worked, but until then, each of the emails listed a different company name, different link (all of which directed to guardnames.com, which appears to be operated from Beijing), and a quote from a philosopher or writer. Which makes me wonder, behind every spammer is there a liberal arts major?</p>
