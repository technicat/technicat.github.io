<p>Tax season is a time for introspection. There&rsquo;s nothing like going over the previous year&rsquo;s receipts, bills, credit card and bank statements to reassess how you&rsquo;re living. After dropping off my payment at the post office last night (which made me wonder why I bothered e-filing and then waiting all day for it be accepted), here are a few observations about my 2011:
</p><ul><li>I spent a lot on take-out.</li>
	<li>While on a contract, a lot of it is In-n-Out and Five Guys.</li>
	<li>That&rsquo;s probably why my doctor lectured me on cholesterol.</li>
	<li>My cholesterol pills have continued to go up in price, even when I switched to generics.</li>
	<li>Apple hardware stayed at the same price. At least it got more powerful.</li>
	<li>The Target card really helps out.</li>
	<li>Moving to a no-sales-tax state would help even more.</li>
	<li>I should have charged more on my last contract.</li>
	<li>I buy only a few computer books a year, now, compared to before, whichÂ explains why most of the books on my shelf are over ten years old.</li>
	<li>I donated a lot of old computer books to the public library (OSF/Motif Programming Reference, anyone?)</li>
	<li>Comic conventions are a bargain compared to graphics, software and game development conventions.</li>
	<li>I &ldquo;buy&rdquo; a lot of free apps, very few paid ones, no in-app purchases.</li>
	<li>Ditto for my customers, apparently.</li>
	<li>Barnes and Noble gave me more paid sales than Amazon.</li>
	<li>Both did better than the Android Market.</li>
	<li>But some are still worse (Handster and some others I won&rsquo;t even bother to name)</li>
	<li>And Apple did better than all.</li>
	<li>Except the Mac App Store.</li>
	<li>I bought a lot of Unity plugins.</li>
	<li>I made some money selling on the Unity Asset Store.</li>
	<li>I spent that money on the Unity Asset Store.</li>
	<li>But I spent way more on Unity itself (Android Pro)</li>
	<li>I bought a few digital tunes (from my music friends)</li>
	<li>I bought a few ebooks (from my author friends)</li>
	<li>I bought and rented a lot of digital video, mostly on my PS3, mostly favorite TV shows (Breaking Bad, Eureka&hellip;)</li>
	<li>I rented a lot from Redbox, less so after they raised the prices from $.99.</li>
	<li>And I still bought quite a few DVD&rsquo;s and BD&rsquo;s.</li>
</ul>
Now I&rsquo;m going to finish my Unity build, browse the Asset Store, then watch a video and read an ebook before bed. Looks like this year will be much like the last. And I could really use a double-double with cheese.
