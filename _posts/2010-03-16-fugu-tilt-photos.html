<p>Since the Unity Enhancement Pack photo picker seemed to liven up my <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=295808255&amp;mt=8">Fugu Maze</a> app, I decided to also add it to <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/fugutilt/id295241739?mt=8">Fugu Tilt</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://itshardtofondlepenguins.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/photo.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3249" title="photo" src="http://itshardtofondlepenguins.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/photo.jpg" alt="" width="480" height="320"/></a></p>

<p>As with Fugu Maze, the photo picker is invoked with a double-tap. I also tweaked the screen-swipe controls so that a horizontal sweep rotates the tilt table, which is closer to the mouse controls of the web player and widget. And I added reflective water from the Unity iPhone Standard Assets and some background ocean sound. Unfortunately, it drowns out the original bouncing sounds, so I&rsquo;ll have to look for some more pronounced sfx to add later.</p>
