I’ve been working on a contract in Rancho Bernardo, part of San Diego, for the last several weeks, and I’ve tried just about every hotel in the area under $200. Here’s a summary:

My go-to hotel is the Courtyard by Marriott. It’s one of the pricier hotels, but it’s the one closest to my workplace and the staff is great - they even comp me a Coke or Dove bar once in a while. I haven’t tried the restaurant - the $11 breakfast buffet might be a good deal - but with all the eateries within walking distance (tip - walk around the little duck park in back for easy access to dim sum, Denny’s, Rubios, a nice Italian sub place…) you have plenty of options, including a Von’s supermarket if you just want to use the room fridge and microwave.

The Hilton Garden Inn just up the road is about the same price and level, with somewhat convenient access to some other restaurants in a different strip mall. They have good fresh-baked cookies (I confess I went back for seconds. And thirds) at the front desk and a nice large lobby.

The best free breakfast can be found at the Staybridge Suites. Really good.

The best value hotel is the Hotel Meridien in Encinitas, just two freeway exits away. Half the price of the other hotels I’m listing here (it’s really a motel), but with nice rooms (great tiling in the bathroom), pretty good internet, and a great TV channel selection. I’m fascinated by the frozen-food vending machine - there’s a vacuum nozzle that suctions the frozen item of your choice (I picked a Hot Pocket) out of a freezer and drops it through the dispenser.

The Rodeway Inn next to the Hooters is closed for renovation. It sports a Norman Bates vibe right now.

There are two other hotels near the Hooters (not that I used that as a hotel search criterion) - the Radisson and the Holiday Inn. Both are about the same price and probably the best value that you can get without going to Encinitas or Poway. The Radisson has a pretty good free breakfast (they give you a ticket)

The Residence Inn has a great manager’s evening reception - barbeque sandwiches and beer (good beer!) while I was there. No wifi, though - I had to plugin in with ethernet.
