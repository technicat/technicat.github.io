I was fortunate to be interviewed as AppBoy’s [Developer of the Week](http://blog.appboy.com/2009/11/interview-philip-chu-they-dont-make-em-like-they-used-to/) last week, but I was a bit startled to read the term “old school” applied to me (they meant it in a good way). I used to think of old school programmers as those guys who programmed in Fortran and COBOL or APL and remnisced about how they used to feed paper tape into computers.

But I guess there’s a whole generation of programmers now who haven’t seen what I’ve seen (do I sound like Rutger Hauer in Blade Runner?) Remember floppy discs? But most of the technology in use then is still around. I thought dot-matrix printers would be gone by now, but anywhere you see carbon copies (or the modern non-carbon equivalent - what do you call those?), there’s a noisy, slow dot-matrix printer. Just saw one in action at Jiffy Lube, today, when they printed out my receipt. Same with languages. I started out with BASIC in high school and then Lisp in college, and they’re still hanging around.

It’s probably easier to date me by listing what wasn’t in existence yet during my formative programming years. The Mac showed up by the time I went to college, but PC’s were still running DOS - Windows was a few years away (the first usable version, anyway). C had been around for a while but C++ was still a gleam in Bjorne’s eye. And forget about Java, .NET and the gazillion scripting languages that arrived during the Internet boom (Perl, Tcl, Python, Ruby….)

And while there was an Internet before the boom, the main Internet applications were email, ftp and something called gopher. There was no web. No web browser. No online shopping, banking, reviewing, blogging, IM'ing, twittering, facebooking, linking in, googling, binging, yahooing, rediting, digging, stack-overflowing…how did I get anything done before the Web? Or maybe I should wonder, how am I getting anything done now?
