I had considered porting my [Fugu Type widget](http://www.apple.com/downloads/dashboard/games/fugutype.html) as an [iPhone app](http://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=361179164&mt=8) since some people seem to particularly like it, but I held off partly because it didn’t seem to me that trying to type fast with the iPhone keyboard would be much fun (based on my own experience trying to compose email on the iPhone), and the keyboard takes up half the screen. On the other hand, I wanted to try out the Unity iPhone keyboard functions, so I figured what the heck. It only took a day - I managed to get it running and submitted just before I went to GDC. During testing, it turned out to be more fun that I expected, and I think it’s improving my iPhone keyboard skills. Perhaps I should make it easier by slowing down the speed of the words as they scroll by (my initial concept was a typing game reminiscent of the game 1942, which I played a lot in college). There are probably some really good iPhone keyboarders out there, so I don’t want to make it too easy.
