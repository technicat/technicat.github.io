<p>So I&rsquo;m browsing back through Christer Ericson&rsquo;s blog and see his article <a href="http://realtimecollisiondetection.net/blog/?p=44">Design Patterns are from Hell</a>, in which he states that the original/classic <b>Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software</b> book from The Gang of Four is &ldquo;one of the worst programming books ever&rdquo;. It wouldn&rsquo;t make my list (<b>Beyond Java</b>), but it&rsquo;s nice to hear someone else say it&rsquo;s not the greatest thing since sliced bread. I&rsquo;ve complained about design patterns to a few (tolerantly-amused) coworkers, and touched on it in an old <a href="http://www.technciat.writing/process.html">anti-Agile essay</a>, but I didn&rsquo;t want to digress into an unfocused grumpy old programmer mode.

I didn&rsquo;t learn about design patterns until relatively late, near the end of the 90&rsquo;s, but that&rsquo;s probably because I started programming before 1990 and I started my career in Lisp. In my experience, you never see Lisp programmers hanging around talking about design patterns - they&rsquo;re usually talking about something much more interesting. And, per <a href="http://norvig.com/design-patterns/">Peter Norvig&rsquo;s argument</a>, design patterns don&rsquo;t seem all that important when you&rsquo;re programming in Lisp. If you need to apply a function through a list or tree, it&rsquo;s a natural feature of the language - you don&rsquo;t need to announce &ldquo;I think I will apply a Visitor pattern&rdquo;.

I first heard about design patterns when a new hire in my group asked me if he could expense the design patterns book, which had been taught in his college. Since I&rsquo;d never heard about it, I said no, but when he purchased it on his own and I leafed through it, I regretted my rejection - the book didn&rsquo;t bring any epiphanies, but it&rsquo;s nice to recognize all these techniques you&rsquo;ve been using with names attached. And it turned out, I had heard of design patterns before - while taking breaks in the library of the <a href="http://stsci.edu/">Space Telescope Science Institute</a>, reading <a href="http://dreamsongs.net/">Richard Gabriel</a>&rsquo;s columns in the Journal of Object Oriented Programming on applying pattern languages to software, inspired by architect <a href="http://www.patternlanguage.com/">Christopher Alexander</a>&rsquo;s attempt to create <b>pattern languages for urban planning</b>. (next time you get an interview quiz on design patterns, ask your questioner about the relationship to Alexander&rsquo;s work and to what extent Alexander&rsquo;s design patterns are considered successful - so there!)

Design patterns started to seem important after I switched to Java - the libraries just ooze design patterns, and you&rsquo;re going to learn them names whether you want to or not (Factory, anyone?) But at least the Java API&rsquo;s are well designed (the greatest appeal of Java for me) Since then, design patterns have come up only in annoying situations, for example:
</p><ul><li>A VP of Engineering vigorously trying to convince I should have used the Flyweight pattern in one of my programs. It turns out I was using the flyweight pattern - I just didn&rsquo;t know it was now a pattern and had that name, and even though I explained how my program worked, since I didn&rsquo;t say &ldquo;flyweight&rdquo; he felt I was missing the boat.</li>
	<li>A review of a coworker&rsquo;s fix to my code - he delightedly said &ldquo;Ah, that&rsquo;s a singleton!&rdquo;, and proceeded to apply the fix clearly without understanding the code (there were multiple instances of the same code that each needed the fix - ironically, he missed that &ldquo;pattern&rdquo;)</li>
	<li>A coworker who called everything he did twice a pattern, even when it was terrible. Especially when it was terrible. With some exaggeration, it would be as if I deliberately had divide-by-zeros everywhere and called it a pattern, thereby justifying it as worthy code.</li>
</ul>
The same goes for <a href="http://www.refactoring.com/">refactoring</a> - heard about, eventually read the classic book by (<a href="http://martinfowler.com/">Martin Fowler</a>), seemed somewhat interesting, useful insofar as support by tools like <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/">Eclipse</a>, but now after listening to people talk about how they&rsquo;re going to refactor today, when it should be a natural, ongoing, and unannounced part of programming (how would it go over in a scrum meeting if I said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to type, today, maybe spend one hour backspacing, two man hours recompiling&hellip;&rdquo;) - enough already!
