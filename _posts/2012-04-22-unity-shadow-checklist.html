<p>The Unity version of HyperBowl started out as a webplayer and was eventually ported to iOS and later to Android. Now I&rsquo;ve close the loop by porting the new Snowpark lane from Android back to a webplayer. In doing so, I tried to add effects that I would have been removing in the other direction, like dynamic shadows. This turned out to be a good way to rediscover every possible thing that can disable shadows. So if you don&rsquo;t see the dynamic shadows you&rsquo;re expecting, here&rsquo;s a checklist:
</p><ul><li>Make sure you&rsquo;re using Unity Pro</li>
	<li>Check your current Quality Settings and make sure dynamic shadows are enabled.</li>
	<li>Check your camera&rsquo;s rendering path - you can use forward rendering if you just have one directional light casting shadows, use deferred rendering if you need more.</li>
	<li>Check your shadow casting light - make sure the culling mask is set so that it&rsquo;s lighting/shadowing what you think it is, make it directional if you need soft shadows or if you&rsquo;re using forward rendering, check the shadow intensity and other shadow settings.</li>
	<li>Check the mesh components on all the shadowing and shadowed objects - make sure the receive and cast shadows checkboxes are checked as desired.</li>
	<li>In the Render Settings check the shadow distance setting. Make sure it&rsquo;s far enough for all your shadows, but also you can optimize a bit by making it near enough to avoid the cost of shadows you don&rsquo;t want to or can&rsquo;t see.</li>
</ul>
