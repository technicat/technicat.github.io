After nearly twenty years in California, the last twelve near the beach, and six months in a nice serviced apartment in Hong Kong, somehow I ended up in New Jersey. I’m not going to pretend that it’s even a lateral move (like Hong Kong, I’m treating it as foreign travel), but it does have its charms. Like this hole-in-the-wall hot-dog place down the street. They only serve hot dogs (though from the name you’d think it was all about drinks), and you can even buy raw hot dogs (and their chili), to go.
