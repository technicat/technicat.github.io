<p>Yesterday YouTube ditched their five-star rating system for thumbs up/down. AppBoy was way ahead of them - my most recent new app, <a href="http://appboy.com/iphone/fugu-type-165842/">Fugu Type</a>, benefited, receiving 15 out of 16 &ldquo;Love It!&quot;s</p>

<p>In contrast, Fugu Type has received no ratings on the App Store. Maybe Apple should follow the trend and dispense with their five-star rating system. I have to admit, my own method for rating apps is suspect (+1 for not crashing, -1 for ads&hellip;)</p>
