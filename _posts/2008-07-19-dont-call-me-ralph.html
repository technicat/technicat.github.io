<p>After watching my health insurance premiums increase five-fold over the last six years, without every incurring expenses beyond my deductible, I finally got around to switching from Healthnet to another provider.</p>

<p>Besides getting my premiums back down, I wanted a plan that was <a href="http://www.ustreas.gov/offices/public-affairs/hsa/">HSA</a>-compatible. But applying for new health insurance is a pain, even on <a href="http://ehealthinsurance.com/">ehealthinsurance</a>, so I wouldn&rsquo;t have bothered if I didn&rsquo;t still have a grudge against Healthnet from a few years ago, when they cashed my premium check, told me they hadn&rsquo;t received it, and then cancelled my policy. And then since I&rsquo;d shown high cholesterol from a recent doctor&rsquo;s visit, I had trouble finding new coverage (<a href="http://www.anthem.com/">Blue Cross</a> sent me a rejection letter that said I was welcome to apply to one of their &ldquo;high risk&rdquo; programs)</p>

<p>Contrary to the standard riff that health coverage would work better if government got out of the way of private insurers, the State of California came to my rescue. Following the instruction in my Healthnet manual, I sent a complaint to the California <a href="http://www.hmohelp.ca.gov/">Department of Managed Health Care</a>, which within a few days replied that they only handle HMO&rsquo;s and not my PPO plan, but they did examine my complaint and agree it appeared valid, so they forwarded it to the appropriate agency, the California <a href="http://www.insurance.ca.gov/">Department of Insurance</a>, which also promptly replied saying they sent Healthnet an inquiry.</p>

<p>Shortly after, I received a letter from the Healthnet legal office explaining that the policy number I&rsquo;d written on my check had been &ldquo;illegible&rdquo; so they&rsquo;d deposited it in another account (apparently the account where they cash any checks they can&rsquo;t identify, that&rsquo;s what &ldquo;illegible&rdquo; means, right? - I suppose it was too much trouble to check the name and address on the envelope?).</p>

<p>Their not-so-subtle attempt to blame me was undermined by typing the wrong name on the letter. In contrast, the case officer from the Department of Insurance sent me a letter some months later apologizing for not following up sooner with details of the reply from Healthnet.</p>
