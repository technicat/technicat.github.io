<p>It pained me to miss Game Seven between the Hornets and Spurs, yesterday, but I felt I had to attend the <a href="http://occs.ieee.org/">IEEE-OCCS</a> talk featuring <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Kay">Alan Kay</a>. I mean, it&rsquo;s Alan Kay - at the legendary <a href="http://www.parc.com/">Xerox Parc</a>, one of the key designers of <a href="http://www.smalltalk.org/">Smalltalk</a>, personal computers with windows and mice (although everyone gets credited with inventing the mouse except the actual inventor, <a href="http://www.ibiblio.org/pioneers/engelbart.html">Doug Engelbart</a>), conceiving the <a href="http://www.artmuseum.net/w2vr/archives/Kay/01_Dynabook.html">Dynabook</a> (the first idea of a laptop), Chief Scientist at Atari, Apple Fellow, Disney Fellow, HP Fellow&hellip;<!--more--></p>

<p>Skipping the basketball game turned out to be the right choice, and not just because I was rooting for the Hornets. It&rsquo;s the first OCCS talk to hold my attention, and one of the few talks I&rsquo;ve attended where the speaker exuded so much intellect and experience that I felt I was just absorbing knowledge by sitting there, even the grumpy old programmer and dogmatic opinion parts (I got that feeling after listening to <a href="http://www.chomsky.info/">Noam Chomsky</a>, <a href="http://web.media.mit.edu/~minsky/">Marvin Minsky</a>, and&hellip;no one else comes to mind)</p>

<p>The talk began with a history of personal computing that was in itself a personal history - from someone who was there with <a href="http://web.mit.edu/invent/iow/sutherland.html">Ivan Sutherland</a> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sketchpad">Sketchpad</a>), and <a href="http://www.papert.org/">Seymour Papert</a> (<a href="http://el.media.mit.edu/Logo-foundation/logo/index.html">Logo</a>) and now involved with the <a href="http://laptop.org/">One Laptop per Child</a> project (the focus of the talk) run by <a href="http://web.media.mit.edu/~nicholas/">Nicholas Negroponte</a>. The presentation described how all those influences converge with the One Laptop project to form a modern Dynabook, using <a href="http://www.squeak.org/">Squeak</a> (a modern Smalltalk) to implement <a href="http://wiki.laptop.org/go/Etoys">Etoys</a>, interactive learning software. And throughout the presentation, references to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johannes_Gutenberg">Gutenberg</a>, <a href="http://www.historyguide.org/intellect/erasmus.html">Erasmus</a>, <a href="http://www.kerryr.net/pioneers/babbage.htm">Babbage</a>, <a href="http://www.marshallmcluhan.com/">McLuhan</a>, <a href="http://galileo.rice.edu/">Galileo</a>&hellip;I want a report on that tomorrow!</p>

<p>Too bad the presentation got dragged down a bit by an argumentative audience member, but otherwise I was inspired to go home, hit the books, and work on my own world-changing software&hellip;until I walked out of the meeting room and saw the Hooters swimsuit competition on the hotel restaurant television.</p>
