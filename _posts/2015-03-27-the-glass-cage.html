My rating: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1190121297">3 of 5 stars</a><br/><br/>
The author brings up a lot of interesting points and case studies of how automation can have the opposite of the intended effect, but halfway through, I feel he is belaboring the point without bringing up solutions (he does mention an improved approach to design, but in a manner that suggests there is some kind of entrenched conspiratorial resistance to it). And I felt like asking him, I bet  you&rsquo;re using a word processor, and not using a typewriter (like Elmore Leonard) or handwriting the book, and you haven&rsquo;t even turned off the spell checker, right?
