I remember when a boss of mine some time back wanted credit for issuing paychecks on time (mostly), I thought (to myself) that paying employees was the absolute minimum obligation of an employer. Any less, it wouldn’t be a company, it would be a charity. What if I wanted a bonus just for showing up to work?

Silly me. And I’m not talking about AIG. Where the game industry may lag historically in such areas as software engineering practices (although I don’t think that’s really true, anymore), when it comes to dubious business practices, the game biz keeps up with the latest fads. Back-dating options and SEC investigations? Take Take-Two. Handing out bonuses while going bankrupt? We have Midway, otherwise known for being one of Sumner Redstone’s long underperforming investments. According to [gamasutra](http://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=22990), Midway execs submitted a bonus plan for milestones already accomplished and milestones they were obligated to complete under bankruptcy proceedings, totalling four times the bonuses awarded when they weren’t going bankrupt. Did they have a meeting and say, “The ship’s going down, let’s divvy up the loot?”
