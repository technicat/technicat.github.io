<p>The recent passing of John McCarthy brought to mind my sole encounter with one of his AI pioneer colleagues, Marvin Minsky. Although I hung around the MIT AI Lab a bit, I only talked to him while I was working as a sales rep at the MIT Microcomputer Center and he called up to get a quote on a Macintosh (this was the very first Mac model - we also had a very expensive Lisa in stock). After getting a price, he congenially asked me my name and then told me his. I was impressed.</p>
