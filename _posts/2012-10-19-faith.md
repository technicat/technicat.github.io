I’ve been watching Faith on Hulu Plus as one of my marathon Korean drama sessions, but I didn’t realize until episode 19 that it’s a current show. So now I’m stuck anxiously awaiting each new episode. A warrior time travels to modern day to find a doctor “from heaven” to save the queen, in actuality kidnapping a cosmetic surgeon, and they become enmeshed in the power struggles of ancient Korea. It’s high concept, with some excellent bad guys. The trailer is in Korean, but you can hear the doctor calling the warrior “psycho”.
