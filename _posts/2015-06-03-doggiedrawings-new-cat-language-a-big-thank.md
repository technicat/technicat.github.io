> NEW: Cat Language!
> 
> A big thank you to the Training and Behavior Dept of [Oregon Humane Society](http://www.oregonhumane.org/) for their help with cat body language information. I have been a cat-less dog person for many many years, so some of this stuff was new to me!&nbsp;

> For example, I didn’t know that cats also emoted with their WHISKERS (relaxed = fanned out and horizontal; anxious = pulled backwards) Pupils, ear positions, body weight, and tails are the other indicators of how a cat is feeling. \*_As with dog body language, we look at the whole body and context_ \*. And yes, cats feel and express DISGUST. I didn’t make this up. :)

> I will be selling 11″ x 17″ and 11″ x 14″ Cat Language prints at [CatConLA](http://www.catconla.com) this weekend, along with other cat-related stuff! I hope to see you there! Booth #333.
