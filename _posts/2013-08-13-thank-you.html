<p>I&rsquo;ve been watching Hulu basically for two reasons: it plays on my PS3 and has a large selection of Korean drama. Some of the shows have a few days delay after their original showing, though, and some shows come and go. I was in the mood recently to watch <a href="http://wiki.d-addicts.com/Thank_You">Thank You</a>, again, and it was gone! But they&rsquo;re all on <a href="http://dramafever.com/">dramafever</a>, which has an iPad app, also.</p>

<p>Thank You is an atypical favorite of mine - mostly I like the fun rom-coms (like My Girl) and action series (like City Hunter), while Thank You is pretty serious - it&rsquo;s about a woman raising a child with AIDS (a rare subject in kdrama, while you there&rsquo;s no shortage of plots involving dementia, cancer and amnesia) - but the leads are good and the kid is great. It&rsquo;s got its fun moments, too.</p>
