<p>The sofa used to be my sanctuary from the Internet, but by now I&rsquo;ve found some free iPhone apps that serve my obssessive-compulsive need to monitor my email, facebook wall, and news feeds.</p>

<p>Using Free RSS, I can monitor newsgroups, in particular the Unity forum.</p>

<p>Tweetdeck is actually better than the Twitter desktop web page. The first time I brought it up, Tweetdeck showed me all the twitter replies I&rsquo;ve missed.</p>

<p>And then there&rsquo;s Facebook. The first time I tried the Facebook iPhone app, I wasn&rsquo;t impressed, but I think they revamped it, because it&rsquo;s got a pretty good interface now, including an easy way to add fan pages as Favorites (short cuts). I don&rsquo;t see any easy way to access group pages, though.</p>
