<p>As the <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2008/03/08/news/companies/countrywide_FBI/index.htm">FBI investigation of Countrywide</a> proceeds, I get another another sketchy mortgage refi offer in the mail:</p>

<p><a href="http://itshardtofondlepenguins.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/img011.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-208" title="img011" src="http://itshardtofondlepenguins.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/img011.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="333"/></a></p>

<p>It&rsquo;s urgent! It&rsquo;s part of a government bill &ldquo;tailored&rdquo; just for me! It&rsquo;s from the official-sounding &ldquo;Department of NAPF&rdquo;! And don&rsquo;t read the fine print!</p>

<p>These guys are easier to find on the web than the last con artists who sent me an offer, the &ldquo;Negotiation Center&rdquo; - they actually have a <a href="http://www.premierfunding.com/">site</a>, and several mentions on <a href="http://www.ripoffreport.com/">Ripoff Report</a> (along with the Negotiation Center)</p>
