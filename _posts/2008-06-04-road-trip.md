Inspired by a friend’s [South American road trip](http://www.roarware.com/southamerica/) and my recent reading of [Route 66: The Mother Road](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/85684.Route_66_The_Mother_Road_75th_Anniversary_Edition), I started driving to Oklahoma earlier this week. Work intervened before I got too far, and I turned back (I have to admit, I was already having second thoughts about all that driving), but at least I did see stretches of historic [Route 66](http://www.historic66.com/). Here’s a fragment in [Devore](http://www.sbsun.com/ci_8283962):
