<p>I was surprised to hear that the App Store is five years old this week. I thought I&rsquo;d been on the App Store longer than that. I guess it just feels that way, but in any case, here&rsquo;s how my four-and-a-half year record on the App Store looks, according to AppViz.</p>

<p>The most important number is the total revenue. In that respect, I slowly ramped up over three years and it&rsquo;s tapered off since. The untold story here is that I&rsquo;ve added Android revenue since then, but still, those were the glory days.</p>

<p>The sales (unit downloads not counting upgrades) graph looks depressingly like a flatline, but I can blame (rationalize) that on a few peak days. I just wish I had more peak days.</p>

<p>App updates don&rsquo;t attract attention like they used to (the App Store originally displayed a running list of updates), but it&rsquo;s nice to see there&rsquo;s an installed base of your apps out there.</p>

<p>This graph of ad impressions shows the point where I started experimenting with ads on one app and then eventually embraced them wholeheartedly.</p>
