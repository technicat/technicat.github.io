<p>App Store approvals have slowed recently - my last two app updates took nine days each (vs three days for the previous app). I was hoping to enter <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/hyperbowl/id344209253?mt=8">HyperBowl</a> in the Unity Awards competition, and I suppose I could have entered the <a href="http://hyperbowl3d.com/">web player</a> instead, but spilt milk, I missed the deadline, since I released it with one of the nearly-final release candidates. Anyway, HyperBowl was approved by Apple yesterday. This screenshot shows two new features - HD resolution on the fourth-gen iPhone and iPod touch, and the addition of the San Francisco lane (only for HD devices - that level is just too heavy for the older hardware).</p>
