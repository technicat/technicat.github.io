Well, I voted for Neil Patrick Harris as the [Best Gay/Bisexual Man of the Decade](http://www.afterelton.com/bgwe/12-23-09?page=0%2C6), although I wish I could also have voted for George Takei and David Hyde Pierce. The title of the list is a bit misleading - as noted in the article it’s really the best pop culture gay/bisexual man of the decade (in an all-time all-category list I’d vote for names like Michelangelo and Alan Turing).

But two steps forward, one step back, as they say. Remember those PSA’s on network TV with Wanda Sykes admonishing us to stop saying “that’s so gay!” I haven’t seen those for a while, but I do still see reruns of Two and a Half Men ignoring Wanda’s advice and saying exactly that. And I just deleted a comment on a Facebook fan page from a teenager who informed me that charging for a game is “gay” (after demanding more free gameplay in all caps). But he is a kid and apparently immature and possibly overindulged by his parents. Television screenwriters - what’s your excuse?
