> > **Pale Blue Dot** is a photograph of planet Earth taken on February 14, 1990, by the Voyager 1 space probe from a record distance of about 6 billion kilometers (3.7 billion miles, 40.5 AU), as part of the Family Portrait series of images of the Solar System.&nbsp;[[Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pale_Blue_Dot)]
> 
> It has been 25 years since Voyager 1 took one of the most iconic photos in human history. Without context this photograph appears to be pixelated noise surrounding a single point of bluish-white dot, seemingly an anomaly in the camera’s optics.
> 
> Proponents of the [Rare Earth hypothesis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rare_Earth_hypothesis)&nbsp;would likely agree that, yes, Earth _is_&nbsp;an anomaly in the Universe, but the Pale Blue Dot image represents something more. [The Blue Marble](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Blue_Marble)&nbsp;gave us the image of Earth as we like to see it - beautiful and peaceful as it moves through blackness of space. It is a home made for us.
> 
> The Pale Blue Dot, on the other hand, gave us the image of Earth we are afraid to see: A lonely speck of dust, utterly fragile and even insignificant. In Carl Sagan’s words: “_Our planet is a lonely speck in the great enveloping cosmic dark. In our obscurity, in all this vastness, there is no hint that help will come from elsewhere to save us from ourselves._”
> 
> Perhaps one day our descendants would look at this image and compare it with what they’re seeing in the windows of their spaceships, straining to see where Earth is. Perhaps one day, 5 billion years from now, our distant descendants would watch in a safe distance while our Sun dies and transforms into a beautiful nebula, wistfully thinking that while Earth was forever gone, its legacy lives on.
