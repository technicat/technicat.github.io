I’m not sure how we’re supposed to have restored confidence in the economy when we basically still have the same people running the same institutions. I suppose I should feel confident that I’m loaning them my tax money. In any case, I’m not that worried - I’m fortunate that I bought my property long ago enough that I still have decent equity (I have to say luck - if I was truly savvy, I would have sold during the bubble). And I’m not terribly insecure about employment - if you’re decent at your job in this business and you’re not an utter pain to work with, you shouldn’t have to whine about outsourcing and H1-B visas (if I ever do, I’ll just complain about Canadians and Scandinavians, just to avoid the monotony of blaming Asians. Seriously, I’ve worked with a lot of Canadians and Norwegians - they just hide among us more easily). If you’re unfairly replaced, chances are it’s by someone right out of college here in the USA, and that’s nothing new - just look at the demographics in Silicon Valley, or your typical game company.

But back to confidence. When it comes to financial institutions, I’d have to say my confidence is decreasing, based on my recent experiences with credit cards. A bank behind one of my company credit cards sent me a letter saying they were getting out of the credit card business, so stop using it. Another bank keeps asking me to apply for a company credit card that I already have. My personal bank persuaded me to sign up for online statements, stopped issuing online statements, and then charged me for a late payment fee. A few weeks ago I was ordering a book online and was asked if I wanted to save $15 bucks instantly by applying for an affiliated credit card. Well sure, but then the online application process informed me we’ll get back to you, back to checkout with the full price of the book. When I asked the credit card company to cancel my application, since I only applied for the instant discount, the rep said sorry, once it’s started, you can’t cancel until you get the approval. A few days later, I received a letter saying they needed more income info from me - if I didn’t supply it, they would take it as a cancellation request.

This is all in the last few months. The Keystone Kops are running our banks.
