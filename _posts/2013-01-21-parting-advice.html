<p>Last week, I gave a talk to some schoolkids about game development. I didn&rsquo;t really prepare, and I think I rambled (it was a Skype video chat, so shades of Max Headroom - I&rsquo;ll send my avatar next time), but I don&rsquo;t believe I scared anyone away. Mission accomplished.</p>

<p>I was asked for some parting advice at the end of the talk, and I&rsquo;m not sure what I actually said, but I thought about it later. Really, I can think of just a couple of things:</p>

<p>Start with something small and simple. Get it done. Then try something a little more challenging next. And so on. Rinse. Repeat. Don&rsquo;t try something big as your first project (attention, everyone who wants to make an MMO) - you won&rsquo;t know where to start, and you&rsquo;ll get discouraged and quit. And you&rsquo;ll probably annoy a lot of people in the process (okay, I&rsquo;d leave out that last part).</p>

<p>The word &ldquo;passion&rdquo; is overused, but on something you&rsquo;re interested in. If you&rsquo;re interested in it, you&rsquo;ll enjoy learning about it, especially on your own, you&rsquo;ll enjoy talking about, and you&rsquo;re more likely to stick with it.</p>

<p>OK, I guess it&rsquo;s just as well I didn&rsquo;t think of those tips. It would have been a short talk.</p>
