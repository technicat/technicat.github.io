Following on from the post of the [Fugu Games](http://www.fugugames.com/) logo design, here’s the design process of the [Technicat](http://www.technicat.com/) logo, also from [Shane Nakamura Designs](http://www.shanenakamuradesigns.com/).

The first pass, to see if anything clicked:

But none did, so Shane made a an entirely different second pass.

This time around, I liked several, including the one near the lower left, but that one reminded me a bit too much of Harvard, and it had a similar form to the Fugu Games logo. The two in the second row from the top feature a nice non-rectangular shape, cool lettering, and neat asymmetric facial features (I’m embarrassed that I didn’t realize they were gamepad controls, but everyone else gets it). The curved enclosure on the left one reminds me of a cat looking out of a pet carrier, so the winner:
