Lately, I haven’t been sure that “bonus” meant what I thought it meant, so I checked the definition on [YourDictionary.com](http://yourdictationary.com/): anything given in addition to the customary or required amount; specif.,

1. payment over and above salary given to an employee as an incentive or reward
2. a government payment to military veterans
3. BRIT.&nbsp;a dividend to insurance policyholders; also, an extra dividend to stockholders
And they also have &nbsp;a “legal” definition: - Wages paid in addition to the compensation ordinarily given or required under an employment contract. A bonus is payment for services (such as for recognition of exceptional work performance) or on consideration, and is neither gift nor gratuity.
- Anything given or provided for free in addition to what is usual, agreed to, or legally due.
