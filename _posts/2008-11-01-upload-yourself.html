<p>I thought it wasn&rsquo;t possible, but I started to feel sorry for Microsoft when their first &ldquo;<a href="http://imapc.lifewithoutwalls.com/watch/">I Am a PC</a>&rdquo; commercials aired, starting with the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Hodgman">John Hodgman</a> (PC guy in the <a href="http://www.apple.com/getamac/ads/">Apple ads</a>) impersonator complaining, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a PC, and I&rsquo;m a stereotype.&rdquo; Watching the rest of the ad is like watching nerds trying to be hip, or PC&rsquo;s trying to be Macs. It might as well be a Mac ad.</p>

<p>Since then, I&rsquo;ve noticed the self-pitying beginning has been dropped, and it seems to me the tone is a bit more aggressive (or am I the only one who sees &ldquo;Up Yours&rdquo; in &ldquo;<a href="http://imapc.lifewithoutwalls.com/">Upload Yourself</a>&rdquo;?). And the guy who&rsquo;s talking about pancakes - what&rsquo;s that about?</p>

<p>As with the moral in John Hughes movies, Microsoft should stop being defensive and just be themselves - instead of trying to be one of the cool kids, they should take a poke at the turtleneck-wearing, goatee sporting &ldquo;creative class&rdquo; (who coined that term? talk about elitism).</p>

<p>For example, the PC-guy clone could take a swing at the Mac guy after yet another snide remark about Vista crashing. (Really, it&rsquo;s pretty obvious the PC guy could take the Mac guy in an all-out fight, or maybe the don&rsquo;t want to bring the DOJ into it again) And they could point out, &ldquo;Yeah, Windows crashes a lot, but a lot of the money you gave us went to the <a href="http://www.gatesfoundation.org/Pages/home.aspx">Gates Foundation</a> and is wiping out malaria and illiteracy. Where&rsquo;s that yearly iPod expenditure going to?&rdquo;</p>

<p>And the I-Am-a-PC videos are on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/WindowsVideos">YouTube</a>, so iPhone/iTouch users can watch. That&rsquo;s a step in the right direction.</p>
