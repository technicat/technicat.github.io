<p>A few years ago I had a camera with some support for creating Quicktime VR panoramas. It worked OK, you basically take a bunch of photos and then manually line them up, and I made some decent-looking panoramas of the beach views here. Last week I tried out the 360 Panorama app on my iPad and expected a similar workflow, but wow, it&rsquo;s a lot easier and faster - basically you just pan around with your device, and then surprisingly quickly, the panorama is viewable and sharable. Here&rsquo;s my <a href="http://360.io/ry7j5j">first attempt</a>, scanning my living room - it&rsquo;s not entirely glitch-free, there&rsquo;s a segment maybe where I panned too fast and there&rsquo;s a tear amid the vertical blinds and that blobby smear hovering in the air is my punching bag (looks like the narrow sand pole got lost amid the blinds).</p>
