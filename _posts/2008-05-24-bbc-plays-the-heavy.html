<p>I was perusing <a href="http://www.neilgaiman.com/">Neil Gaiman</a>&rsquo;s blog last week and saw mention of the <a href="http://bbc.co.uk/">BBC</a> ordering the operator of the web site <a href="http://mazzmatazz.co.uk/">Mazzmatazz</a> to take down postings of original <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/">Doctor Who</a> knitting patterns she created depicting the characters Ood and Adipose (according to <a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article3949935.ece">this article</a>, the Doctor Who producers were more enthusiastic about the patterns). After some public outcry, the BBC has backed off a bit and decided to adopt the patterns as official BBC products.</p>
