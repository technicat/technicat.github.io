<p>Just kidding. I&rsquo;m not going to defend crunch time. Although the recent &ldquo;quality of life&rdquo; allegations about Rockstar San-Diego prompted me to reminisce about my own crunch-time experiences. I thought I&rsquo;d see how they fell into the following categories:
</p><ul><li>Unavoidable (no way around it, you should have expected it)</li>
	<li>Unfortunate (now you have to clean up after a boneheaded management mistake)</li>
	<li>Regrettable (completely pointless, sorry for wasting your time)</li>
</ul>
As I can best recall, the crunch times I experienced before I started working in the game biz fell more or less equally into those three categories. Some examples:
<ul><li>Unavoidable - getting a vaporware product into demoable shape for a trade show. Worked around the clock for several days with a 1-2 hours sleep each day until we shipped the machines to show. I guess it was worth it - there wouldn&rsquo;t have been any point in going to the show otherwise. Although I got food poisoning at the show and then the flu right after I got back, so I don&rsquo;t know.</li>
	<li>Unfortunate - working 12-16 hours a day for a month, including a couple of weeks with the flu, to get some simulation software ready for a military wargame sim, after management realized the guy who said &ldquo;it&rsquo;ll be ready tomorrow&rdquo; for six months didn&rsquo;t really mean it.</li>
	<li>Regrettable - working over the weekend to create an installer for a software delivery. Went to bed at 5am only to get a call at 8am that the software was crashing at the client site. Turns out one of our products installed by the installer had never been installed by the client before and not only didn&rsquo;t run, but caused bad things to happen when installed.</li>
</ul>
That&rsquo;s better than I expected, and the regrettable instance would have been avoided if I just hadn&rsquo;t volunteered (I got suckered in by that &ldquo;team player&rdquo; thing during a meeting). I think in most cases, people just won&rsquo;t show up for crunch time - something about having families or a life or something. Anyway, I noticed during my crunch times I was pretty much alone in the office.

Then there&rsquo;s the game industry. Here&rsquo;s a representative sample:
<ul><li>Called in on the weekend to get a demo version ready for a demo disc. Then management changed their minds and decided not to send out the disc.</li>
	<li>Crunched to get a release out because management promised to deliver the game a month early. I guess it was good practice for our regularly scheduled crunch a month later.</li>
	<li>Crunched after the game was cancelled by the publisher, in the vain hopes the publisher would change their minds. I guess we were crunching in denial.</li>
	<li>Crunched because management gave us a fake early due date. We released on that date, so I guess they outsmarted us! But still, I&rsquo;m not sure releasing a build with an untested level was a great idea. It worked, but no one noticed the level hadn&rsquo;t gone through any optimization.</li>
</ul>
All regrettable. It seems like there I should have seen at least one justifiable game dev crunch, but I can&rsquo;t recall any. The problem is that crunches are fun - for management. It even sounds like fun - &ldquo;crunch&rdquo;. As opposed to the mainstream software engineering designation - &ldquo;Death March&rdquo;. These crunches are gratuitous - unnecessary, but they provide cheap thrills. I&rsquo;ll admit it - if I was in charge, the sight of sweaty developers, flatulent with late-night takeout and cursing their lot while staring bleary-eyed at their screens would be more reassuring than a relaxed team shooting the breeze and web-surfing during the day and then playing the latest popular coop shooter before going home. We&rsquo;d all love to be Captain Kirk or Captain Picard - make it so!
