[TripAdvisor](http://www.tripadvisor.com/) makes it easy to embed a places-I’ve-been map in a web page:

- [Visit TripAdvisor.com](http://www.tripadvisor.com/)

As you can see from the map, I’ve gotta get out of the country more (at least to Mexico). The map is “Powered by Google” so you could of course just use [Google Maps](http://maps.google.com/) directly, but if you’re a TripAdvisor reviewer, this map will link to your profile and contributions. I haven’t tried review-writing, but it seems TripAdvisor is the go-to site for travel reviews (my trip-preparation google searches always end up there). The Terms of Use reserve the right to edit your review, and the wording isn’t very clear (compared to [Epinions](http://www.epinions.com/)) on whether you retain ownership (but the implication is that you do). On the other hand, it doesn’t seem to include an indemnification clause, which is a refreshing change.
