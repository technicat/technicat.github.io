When it comes to social network sites, I feel a bit like Goldilocks. [MySpace](http://myspace.com/) is too messy, [LinkedIn](http://linkedin.com/) is too dull, and [Facebook](http://facebook.com/) is just right.

But if you can’t see any more of this blog entry, chances are you’re reading it from my Facebook wall - the blog import option is convenient, but it truncates the entries, leaving out media and links and even some whitespace, and only shows links to the original articles in the Notes panel. So every imported blog entry looks like I got distracted after a sentence or two and wandered off to make a sandwich.

And then there are the third-party applications. The [Goodreads](http://goodreads.com/) app is ideal, importing updates from my Goodreads account onto my Facebook wall. But as far as I can tell, apps like those from [TripAdvisor](http://tripadvisor.com/) and [LivingSocial](http://livingsocial.com/) don’t connect to an existing outside account - they require you to enter new content from scratch within your Facebook account. There’s still an Internet outside Facebook, so I’d rather spend time creating content that more than my handful of Facebook friends can see (Now, if I had over 9000 “friends” like one Facebook user I saw, then that it’d be a different story)

The apps also deviate from the clean design of Facebook. Normally, ads on Facebook are relatively unobtrusive, but once you enter an app page, they start getting in your face, showing up in the left hand column, exhibiting text that misleadingly looks like it might be from Facebook (“two friends have a crush on you!”), and even banner ads (LivingSocial has a big Netflix banner ad). And the behavior is not limited to ads - once an app gloms onto your account, it can start bugging you. Does WordTwist really need to randomly send me notifications that I should play it? And every time I log in fresh to Facebook NetworkBlogs shows up, before I tried it, and after I tried it and removed it. The only way to avoid it is if I log in and never leave. Hmm…
