> **Sponsored Links on Tumblr’s Desktop Dashboard:**  
> Tumblr began serving sponsored links on the Desktop Dashboard. These sponsored links stand out as two side-by-side, rectangular display ads. They are not the “native ad” sponsored posts meant to blend into the Dash.
> 
> I don’t think Tumblr is giving up on native advertising. Its [newly announced Creatrs program](http://staff.tumblr.com/post/108836420670/hey-creative-people-tumblr-already-loves-your) pairs artists in the Tumblr community with brands to make creative advertising, tailored for the platform.
> 
> But the move to web Dashboard sponsored links marks a change in ad strategy. The shift correlates with recent news that parent company [Yahoo is merging Tumblr’s ad sales team into its own](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-02-07/tumblr-ad-executive-stepping-down-as-yahoo-combines-teams).
