When I was enthusiastic about Asian food in California, Iâ€™m not exaggerating. I really had almost negligible knowledge of Japanese food, Korean food, Thai food, and Vietnamese food before I moved here. Even Chinese food. Take this scallion pie, for instance. My Mom made this when I was a kid, but inventively substituted tortillas for the crust. It makes a difference. But maybe that tortilla version could catch on (fusion, right?)
