Facebook ads are starting to freak me out. Check out this latest batch - I did look at a glassdoor employee review of New Relic. Bacon? OK, maybe I Liked a bacon page on Facebook (if they have some info on me and boxers, well…). Homeland? I just watched the final episode recently. That’s creepy. The Avengers? Did they follow me to that Vegas movie theater on opening week?
