I try to alternate among big projects and little ones - here’s one of the little ones, I just released on the Android Market as [Fugu System](https://market.android.com/details?id=com.technicat.fugusystem). This originally was going to be a credits screen a long time ago, showing off Unity water, lens flare, bump mapping, but recently I thought it would nice to have a some kind of system info display app (up til now, I’ve been cramming that info into my pause screens). It doesn’t have all the information I want, like storage space remaining, but through the Unity SystemInfo class I have some hardware information. I threw in an FPS indicator and tap-to-toggle for the graphics so it acts as a minimal 3D benchmark.
