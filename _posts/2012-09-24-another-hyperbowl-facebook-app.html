<p>My third attempt at deploying <a href="https://apps.facebook.com/126959907158/">HyperBowl as a Facebook app</a>. The first two were via DimeRocker. This time around, I was just playing around with Heroku to try some Ruby on Rails stuff and I got distracted from my original goal when I found that the Facebook developer page has an option to automatically populate a Heroku account with an app template. So I just wedged a copy of the <a href="http://hyperbowl3d.com/">HyperBowl web site</a> into a PHP template for a Facebook app. And by the way, I love using git to upload to Heroku.</p>
