After my latest home office reorg, I now have my Apple TV next to my MacBook Pro, which somehow seems right except that the Apple TV remote also wants to control my Mac. It’s pretty annoying to have iTunes pop up every time I try to watch a movie. But I had to do some googling to figure out how to avoid that - turns out the place where that is enabled/disabled is in Settings-\>Personal-\>Security. If it’s a security option, shouldn’t it be off by default?
