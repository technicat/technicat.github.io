This seems “less than very good” to me. Only a truncated view of the latest message is visible on the left despite having a whole column available, and there’s little room to see the entire thread on the right. In fact, it’s not obvious there’s a scrolling view on the right (although that’s an issue with Apple’s standard disappearing scrollbar)
