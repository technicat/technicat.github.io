[WordsEye Feature](http://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=305827351&mt=8) is now on the App Store. It displays a random scene created and “featured” on the [WordsEye web site](http://www.wordseye.com/).

It’s passive entertainment, but I think it’s one of the more interesting apps I have on my iPod Touch. The images look great, and the source text scrolling by gives you an idea how they were created.
