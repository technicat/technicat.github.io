<p>Web programming isn&rsquo;t one of my favorite things, but I found it&rsquo;s actually a nice break from game programming. So when I got the latest <a href="http://appviz.com/">AppViz</a> update which includes revenue figures in its Totals by Product export, I extended the PHP script for my <a href="http://fugugames.com/">Fugu Games</a> site to show the App Store revenue breakdown for my apps, which differs from the download totals (click on the boxes at top to switch between them). You can see here that the various <a href="http://hyperbowl3d.com/">HyperBowl</a> apps comprise about 70% of the earnings with Fugu Maze and Fugu Bowl bringing in most of the rest.</p>
