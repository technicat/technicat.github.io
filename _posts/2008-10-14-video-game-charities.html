<p>Last week I dropped off my annual donation to <a href="http://www.get-well-gamers.org/">Get Well Gamers</a>, a charity founded by <a href="http://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=11309">Ryan Sharpe</a> that supplies video games as a pain management tool for children recovering in hospitals. They&rsquo;re located here in Huntington Beach, so it&rsquo;s a convenient drive-by for me, I unload all the video games I&rsquo;ll never get around to playing (everything that&rsquo;s not the latest generation), and I could use the tax break (it&rsquo;ll make a tiny dent in what I lost in home and stock market value this year).</p>

<p>A google search for other video game charities proved disappointing, listing more charity events than sustaining charity organizations, but I did find a few that looked promising, e.g. the <a href="http://gamersoutreach.org/">Gamers Outreach Foundation</a> and another one for hospital-bound children, <a href="http://www.childsplaycharity.org/">Child&rsquo;s Play</a>. In an industry not exactly known for maturity, it&rsquo;s encouraging to see some do-gooding.</p>
