I can’t say I really miss using typewriters - I tended to type fast, clumping up the keys, and used a lot of whiteout fixing the corresponding keys (so you could say my typing style was destined for computer keyboards), and I never got around to writing a famous novel on one. But I did use a typewriter as my first printer, transcribing my Apple II BASIC listings from screen to paper.

And typewriter action is just cool. I always thought a typewriter app would be cool (but notice how I didn’t go around saying “I have a great idea for an app if someone would just to the programming…”), and indeed from no other than Tom Hanks (or his wallet), comes this this typewriter app, called Hanx. See, if you really do have a good app idea, someone will make it!
