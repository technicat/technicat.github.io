I also considered titling this article Droids to Avoid or This is Your App on Android. Anyway, with the latest update, [HyperBowl](https://market.android.com/details?id=com.technicat.HyperBowl)is now my most-downloaded app on the Android Market. And the ratings so far are a good-new, bad-news situation, the good news being all the five-star ratings and the bad news being the one-star ratings. Based on the comments, one star indicates it didn’t run on the user’s device and five stars indicates it did run.

So I’m declaring victory (a moral victory, not the kind of victory you can cash at the bank). In the meantime, I’m adding the mentioned problematic devices to my device exclusion list (if only they had a device+OS exclusion list, then I could take care of that Samsung Galaxy with Android 2.1 issue).

I’ve learned a few things, too. Once you get to around 2000 downloads, you’ll see pirated versions on around the web. Which doesn’t seem to make any sense considering it’s already free, but I guess it’s like that guy I knew in high school who had floppy discs full of any pirated programs he could find (yes, floppy discs - if you have to ask, go back to your texting or whatever).

Another, people really do buy apps on the Android Market. Out of 2700 HyperBowl downloads so far, 14 have purchased [HyperBowl Pro](https://market.android.com/details?id=com.technicat.HyperBowlPro), which is not a lot but more than I expected. Meaning some people really like it or those Admob banner ads get in the way (which is really why I made the Pro version, ad-free makes for a much nicer demo plus I wanted to try out the OpenFeint plugin, and I don’t feel like trying to mix plugins).

Finally, even with the one-star reviews (and the guy who told me to “work on it”), Android freebie users are nicer than iOS free app downloaders. Maybe the Android users are older, or less drunk with power, or not as imbued with Apple hubris, or are less likely to be self-styled game critics (you can often identify them when they say what control scheme they would have used). Android users are now apparently trained to helpfully report their device models, so now if I’m hiring QA staff, my first interview question is “Do you have an Android phone or iPhone?”

I did have one nasty comment for HyperBowl on Android - the user gave me one star because HyperBowl didn’t run on his Optimus V and called it “a piece of shit”, but then the comment was removed. Whether it’s because it ran the next time he tried it (the Optimus V is listed as one of the few ARMv6 devices Unity Android is supposed to run on), or because he had a change of heart about his tone, or because there’s some Google moderation process that removes scatological reviews, I’m now left wondering whether HyperBowl does or doesn’t run on the Optimus V. At least I googled the specs and now know it’s the letter V and not the roman numeral V. Too bad - all this time I’ve been pronouncing it like it’s the name of a Transformer.
