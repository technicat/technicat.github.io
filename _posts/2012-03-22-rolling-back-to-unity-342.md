I’m alternating between Unity 3.5 and 3.4.2 - I’ve upgraded everything but [HyperBowl](http://hyperbowl3d.com/) since there are still graphics and performance issues. But I often lose the 3.4.2 installer and have to search for the old download links on the Unity forum, so here they are, if you need to roll back:

[http://download.unity3d.com/download\_unity/unity-3.4.2.dmg](http://download.unity3d.com/download_unity/unity-3.4.2.dmg)

[http://download.unity3d.com/download\_unity/UnitySetup-3.4.2.exe](http://download.unity3d.com/download_unity/UnitySetup-3.4.2.exe)
