<p>I went into the advertising business last week, on the web and on the iPhone. Here are my iAds results for the last three days for <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/fugu-bowl/id297032758?mt=8">Fugu Bowl</a>:</p>

<p><a href="http://itshardtofondlepenguins.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/Screen-shot-2010-10-03-at-11.36.22-PM.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3860" title="Screen shot 2010-10-03 at 11.36.22 PM" src="http://itshardtofondlepenguins.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/Screen-shot-2010-10-03-at-11.36.22-PM.png" alt="" width="202" height="128"/></a></p>

<p>and Google Adsense results for the same three days:</p>

<p><a href="http://itshardtofondlepenguins.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/Screen-shot-2010-10-03-at-11.36.59-PM.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3861" title="Screen shot 2010-10-03 at 11.36.59 PM" src="http://itshardtofondlepenguins.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/Screen-shot-2010-10-03-at-11.36.59-PM.png" alt="" width="680" height="159"/></a></p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not getting mortage-paying numbers for either platform (or even lunch-paying numbers), but so far iAds is the superior performer (and just on one app). On the other hand, the Google Ad revenue from my <a href="http://hyperbowl3d.com/">HyperBowl</a> site beats what I&rsquo;m getting from the game portals I&rsquo;ve deployed it on. But my app sales are still beating my ad revenue, so I won&rsquo;t be switching entirely to an ad-based revenue model&hellip;yet.</p>
