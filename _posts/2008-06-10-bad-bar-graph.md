Here’s a simple but bad graphic representation, courtesy of my mobile phone provider:

It’s just a bar graph that shows my remaining minutes. At first glance, you’d think that I was running out of time, but the opposite is true. The bar extends right-to-left, not left-to-right. The red area represents my remaning minutes, so the amount of red actually decreases as I use up my time - when I reach my limit, there will be no red in the graphic - when I’ve used no minutes, the graph is completely red.

I suppose this makes sense from their viewpoint - “emergency, our customer is under quota!”, and later, “ah, relax, now he’s getting billed for extra minutes”. But if you want to make a bar graph that doesn’t mislead, examine this one, and do the opposite. Wow, I hope they’re not designing, say, mobile phone interfaces.
