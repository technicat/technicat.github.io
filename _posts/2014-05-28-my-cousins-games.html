<p>I don&rsquo;t see my relatives a lot, but when I do, I always discover something really cool about them. For instance, at my grandmother&rsquo;s birthday dinner last year, I saw a nice looking motorcycle with sidecar in the parking lot, and once in side I found that my uncle and aunt ride around the country in that thing. At the same dinner, I ran into a cousin who&rsquo;s had a long-standing interest in game development and has recently started to move his education and career in that direction. Check out his <a href="http://alin2013.wix.com/aaronlin">games</a>.</p>
