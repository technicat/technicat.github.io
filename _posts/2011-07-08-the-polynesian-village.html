<p>I was just thinking about how I&rsquo;ve been here in Huntington Beach for ten years and it&rsquo;s time for a move and if I moved I&rsquo;d have to find an apartment&hellip;so I found some reviews I wrote based on my apartment-hopping past (12 apartments in 12 years!). There&rsquo;s one I-hated-this-place review of an Archstone property, so I&rsquo;ve vowed never to live in one of those again, and a nostalgic one of a cheap and kitschy apartment I moved into when I came out to California from Boston (one of those fork-in-the-road career moves - save that for another blog). Ironically, that place, the Polynesian Village, has been razed and replaced with an Archstone complex. Here&rsquo;s my old review:
</p><blockquote>I gather they&rsquo;re tearing down these apartments. I don&rsquo;t know if they&rsquo;ll  be replaced with a new complex or something else, but here&rsquo;s a review  for nostalgia&rsquo;s sake.

The Polynesian Village was my first apartment when I moved to LA  eight years ago, and it was wonderfully appropriate as my introduction  to Southern California. A cheap studio with concrete walls and a view of  aspiring starlets by the pool in an open-air complex with a kitschy  name and look (&ldquo;polynesian&rdquo; isn&rsquo;t just the name). It was just over the  hill from the beach and I had to pause during my phone conversations for  the planes flying overhead from nearby LAX.

The management was very friendly and very reasonable about the rent.  My lease was automatically continued month-to-month with no increase  after my first year lease expired. I think the rent did go up at some  point, but not by much - I hardly remember.

Safety in Playa Del Rey didn&rsquo;t seem to be an issue, although I had a  friend/coworker in the complex who had his tires repeatedly slashed.  But just his car was targeted, for some reason. And there was that time I  saw an opossum sauntering around the pool on my first night there.  Being from Boston, I thought it was a gigantic rat, and I was conflicted  between the desire to shoot it with the nearest available firearm and  the urge to flee back to Boston. I&rsquo;m glad to say, I&rsquo;m still here.
