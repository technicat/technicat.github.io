I like the bathrooms at two of my favorite Orange County shopping centers, [Fashion Island](http://shopfashionisland.com/) and [South Coast Plaza](http://southcoastplaza.com/) - they’re clean and well-ventilated, with nice tile and counters. And the wooden toilet stall doors look elegant, but at the expense of usability.<!--more-->

Of course, they’re usable - they’re just doors. But there are doors, and there are doors. This kind has no handle, so you have to guess that you need to push, and the doors close whether or not the stall is occupied.

So if you don’t immediately assume that all stalls are occupied, you have to go down the row and give each one a push to see if it’s open. Which could result in the worst-case scenario: door opens, but stall is occupied (and again, since the door automatically closes, it would be easy to forget to latch). My safety practice - step back, lean, and look for shoes.
