> I just thought I’d share with you guys some of my favorite pictures I took in 2014. I also want to thank everyone for all your support, it means a lot. I haven’t been doing much street photography lately but that it’s do to this freezing weather we’ve been having. Lol Stay tuned though cause once it warms up it’s on. Also, I’ve received hundreds of questions you guys have inboxed me but haven’t been able to answer them all, I’m going to try to answer as many as I can little by little. Thank you guys once again, your support has helped me become a better photographer and graphic designer.
