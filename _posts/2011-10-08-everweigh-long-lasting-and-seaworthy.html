<p><em>Originally written on Epinions in May 2004:</em></p>

<p>In an embarrassing lapse of tub management, I recently overflowed my bathroom. One of the apparent casualties was my <strong>Health-O-Meter EverWeigh</strong> scale. With water still dripping out the bottom, I gave it a try - the required initial foot-tap to activate it showed signs of life - the expected &ldquo;888&rdquo; display on the LED - but I just got &ldquo;00&rdquo; when I put my full weight on it. But after leaving it on the floor for a day, I tried the scale again and it displayed the expected reading (which I won&rsquo;t state here).</p>

<p>More expected than this impressive water-resistance is the battery-life. The scale is powered by a non-replaceable lithium battery (I looked for an obvious way to open up the scale and there is none), and I&rsquo;ve had this scale for as long as I can remember, probably at least five years (which I believe is the typical warranty on these things), so I&rsquo;m just guessing that I paid $15-$20 for it. The whole casing is plastic, so it is very light and easily carryable with the handle formed above the display.</p>

<p>The EverWeigh is easy to use, but I don&rsquo;t like having to tap and wait for the scale to activate - once in a while I need to tap it multiple times to get the required &ldquo;888&rdquo; then &ldquo;0&rdquo; to show up (the LED display has three digits, with precision to one pound). Foot placement on the scale appears to be important - you&rsquo;ll get different readings if you&rsquo;re off to the side a bit - so some markings would have been nice. I normally take more than two or three readings, until I&rsquo;m satisfied that I&rsquo;ve got two identical readings in a row. I don&rsquo;t have another scale to compare the accuracy with, but a recent weighing at my doctor&rsquo;s office gave me a number consistent with the EverWeigh&rsquo;s readings.</p>

<p>My biggest displeasure is that the EverWeigh doesn&rsquo;t work on carpeting, which rules out use in one of my bathrooms. The written info underneath the scale states that it is less reliable on heavy carpets, but that&rsquo;s quite an understatement. My carpet is not at all heavy, but apparently I weight fifty pounds less on it.</p>
