<p>A few weeks ago I received a rejection letter from Steam for <a href="http://hyperbowl3d.com/">HyperBowl</a>. Of course, no one likes to get rejected, but, at the risk of sounding like sour grapes, it&rsquo;s kind of a relief. I prefer to concentrate on mobile apps for both technical and business reasons, and it&rsquo;s just more fun.</p>

<p>I like targeting devices with fixed hardware specs rather than waiting for complaint involving mystery PC/GPU/OS configurations (often when I ask someone to report that information, all I get is &ldquo;Windows&rdquo;), and Apple set the bar with the App Store, with a low barrier of entry ($99 yearly, compared to the $1000/submission Motorola charged when I wanted to get into mobile with J2ME apps years ago), a transparent business arrangement (70/30, which is now standard), and published acceptance guidelines (although there&rsquo;s enough generality there they can pretty much reject anything they want).</p>

<p>In addition, there are the multiple app markets available on Android, with various quirks and features of their own (Amazon and Appia, formerly Handango, have some obnoxious pricing controls), but there is a world of difference between them and the desktop market. Everything about Steam is confidential - the revenue share, technical requirements, even the rejection letter I got said it wasn&rsquo;t their policy to disclose the reason for the rejections. And it&rsquo;s not just Steam - go to any PC/Mac publisher site, even indies, and it&rsquo;s &ldquo;contact us&rdquo; vs. &ldquo;sign up, and upload your apps!&rdquo; (I did have high hopes for the Mac App Store, but after they rejected HyperBowl because of other versions - &ldquo;It&rsquo;s been repurposed too much&rdquo;, I think they need an attitude adjustment)</p>

<p>Now, there are plenty who complain unrestricted self-publishing leads to app stores crowded with mediocrity, but I think any of them will change their tune as soon as they have their own apps rejected (no one thinks their own baby is ugly). Try working on a game project where you have to go through a traditional publisher to access the distribution channel and your livelihood (and often your IP) lies in their hands. Then you&rsquo;ll appreciate the &ldquo;self&rdquo; in self-publishing.</p>
