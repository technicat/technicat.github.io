<p>Despite the decent December sales, the low ratings for <a href="http://hyperbowl3d.com/">HyperBowl</a> on the Amazon Appstore have been irritating, and totally out of whack with the ratings on all the other app stores (for example, it averages 4-5 stars on the Nook store).

But now it&rsquo;s getting better - here are the latest 5 and 4 star <a href="http://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B005XQ9D5E">Amazon reviews</a>:
</p><blockquote>I think it is awesome also creative.I think it is dumb that people put a rating as 1.HYPERBOWL IS AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!!

whoever wrote those other comments are nuts. This game is awesome!! I play it at least 10 times a day!! IT&rsquo;S AWESOME!!!</blockquote>
I love it when customers come to your defense!
