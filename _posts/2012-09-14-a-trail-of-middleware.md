I’m not really familiar with Torque but I’m under the impression it never had the ecosystem of extra middleware that Unity has - the plugins, assets and tools that surround it like pilot fish around a shark (that doesn’t sound very nice but I mean it as a compliment). Here’s a list off the top of my head of commercial Unity extras that I’ve actually used and deployed (not all at once):

iPhone Enhancement Pack  
iAd, AdMob, iCade, Game Center and Etcetera plugins from prime312  
iTween  
GUIKit001  
EZGUI  
NGUI  
Localization Package  
Transitions Manager  
inneractive plugin  
Scoreloop plugin  
Openfeint plugin  
Zeemote SDK

I could have sworn that I used more, and this doesn’t include art and sound assets, but in any case, I’ve got a long list that I haven’t got around to, yet.
