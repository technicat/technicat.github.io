<p>Unity kindly invited me to join the beta of their<a href="https://dashboard.uca.cloud.unity3d.com/signin"> Cloud Analytics</a> a while ago, and the data recently just started kicking in. I really like their charts, especially the ability to compare iOS vs. Android numbers (on Chartboost, the iOS and Android IDs are separate, and despite its name, they removed the charts).</p>

<p>The iOS data is playing catchup to Android since the apps had to go through Apple review, of course, but already you can see the Apple numbers dominate (although these days Android AdMob revenue is actually higher than iAd - so, Unity Ads next?).</p>

<p>Next round of updates, I think I&rsquo;ll try the custom events feature, which should be interesting. Here&rsquo;s the <a href="http://www.playnomics.com/sign-up.html">Unity Analytics signup page</a> if you&rsquo;re interested.</p>
