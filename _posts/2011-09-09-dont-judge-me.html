<p>So the other day I was staying in a Holiday Inn Express in Dana Point and decided to try out the BBQ place next door. I regretted it immediately, as it turned into a sequence of my least favorite scenarios. There was one guy at the bar who looked like he&rsquo;d been occupying that seat for a long time, who proceeded to quote scripture to me (&ldquo;Judge not lest ye be judged&rdquo;), then interrogated me about my &ldquo;nationality&rdquo; (&ldquo;Japanese? Filipino?&rdquo;), then wanted me to help him with his Android phone.</p>

<p>Once we got his phone working, though, he made me google his name and it turns out he&rsquo;s a local skateboarding legend, Stitch Hitchcock.</p>



<p>I later read about him in an article on the <a href="http://www.ocweekly.com/2009-01-15/news/skitch-hitchcock-salt-creek-beach-crew-skateboarding/">Salt Creek Beach Crew</a>, which really just depressed me more to see that he&rsquo;s drinking again (if not, I can&rsquo;t account for why he sang me a farewell, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m turning Chinese, I&rsquo;m turning Chinese&hellip;&rdquo;) So I took my BBQ back to my room, which amazingly for a budget hotel had a jacuzzi tub and flat-screen TV in the bathroom, and watched HBO while munching on BBQ and sitting in the tub. Don&rsquo;t judge me.</p>
