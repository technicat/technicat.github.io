The torch flames in HyperBowl Rome never looked that great - the original was a 2D sprite, and the basic particle systems I replaced it with at least looked 3D but still didnâ€™t look like real flame. I think my latest attempt is an improvement. This time I used the modestly-priced Real Flames package from the Unity Asset Store, which has a much more flickery look (vs. the puffs of flame I was using before) and conveniently comes with a light flicker script.
