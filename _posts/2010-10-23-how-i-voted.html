<p>I&rsquo;m not voting as dumb as I used to. In past years, I&rsquo;ve stood in line at the polling sites only to gaze without recognition on the various propositions, school board candidates and local judges on the ballot.</p>

<p>Now, as a mail-in voter with Internet access, there&rsquo;s no excuse. Last election, I spent a lot of time googling for candidate sites. This year, I took more advantage of the<a href="http://smartvoter.org/"> Smart Voter</a> site.</p>

<p>I still used some simplistic rules in my voting. After Meg Whitman&rsquo;s who-can-be-tougher-on-immigrants Republican campaign, she&rsquo;s out. Similarly, though I&rsquo;m no Carly Fiorina fan, I&rsquo;m getting tired of hearing Barbara Boxer&rsquo;s tirade against outsourcing to &ldquo;China!&rdquo; and &ldquo;Bangalore!&rdquo; (reminiscent of the Democrats&rsquo; union-appeasing Japan bashing, back when everyone was scared of Japan)</p>

<p>Some candidates didn&rsquo;t even try, not even bothering to set up a web site or post a position statement on SmartVoter. That was the case with Rosalynd Freeman, the Democratic candidate running against Jim Silva, but still I couldn&rsquo;t vote for Silva, after reading one of his editorials blaming the mortgage crisis on government policies and duplicitous homeowners and saying the banks were just doing what they&rsquo;re supposed to do. And most of the local school board candidates didn&rsquo;t have web sites either, but I couldn&rsquo;t vote for the guy who plastered animated waving American flags all over his site (I would have overlooked the offense to web design if he&rsquo;d displayed books, instead)</p>

<p>All in all, I didn&rsquo;t feel there were any momentous choices this year (no Prop 8, no Schwarzenegger), except I did vote for Prop 19 to legalize marijuana. It&rsquo;s time we stopped importing weed from Mexico and spend that money on the California crop. I&rsquo;m with Senator Boxer on this one. Buy American!</p>
