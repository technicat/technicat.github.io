<p>Seriously, my nephews know all the popular games, more than I do, and they can get play through a lite version of a game faster than you can say &ldquo;Lodsys&rdquo;. I even gave them a Unity demo - showing them how I have HyperBowl in Unity and then showing them the running build on my iPad, and they actually exclaimed &ldquo;Oh, cool!&rdquo; nearly in unison. I can see the next Unity forum posting: &ldquo;Seeking team of like-minded 4-8 year olds for an MMORPG project!&rdquo;</p>
