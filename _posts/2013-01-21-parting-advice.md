Last week, I gave a talk to some schoolkids about game development. I didn’t really prepare, and I think I rambled (it was a Skype video chat, so shades of Max Headroom - I’ll send my avatar next time), but I don’t believe I scared anyone away. Mission accomplished.

I was asked for some parting advice at the end of the talk, and I’m not sure what I actually said, but I thought about it later. Really, I can think of just a couple of things:

Start with something small and simple. Get it done. Then try something a little more challenging next. And so on. Rinse. Repeat. Don’t try something big as your first project (attention, everyone who wants to make an MMO) - you won’t know where to start, and you’ll get discouraged and quit. And you’ll probably annoy a lot of people in the process (okay, I’d leave out that last part).

The word “passion” is overused, but on something you’re interested in. If you’re interested in it, you’ll enjoy learning about it, especially on your own, you’ll enjoy talking about, and you’re more likely to stick with it.

OK, I guess it’s just as well I didn’t think of those tips. It would have been a short talk.
