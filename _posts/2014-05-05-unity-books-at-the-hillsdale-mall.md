The Barnes and Noble by the Hillsdale Mall in San Mateo is now officially my favorite bookstar. Or at least my favorite Barnes and Noble. It’s got a pretty good selection of Unity books, including my Learn Unity 4 for iOS Game Development. And they’ve even been restocking my book. I know that because the last time I saw my book on their shelf, I bought it, and there it is again!
