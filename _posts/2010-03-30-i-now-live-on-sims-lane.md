I noticed a few weeks ago that the City of Huntington Beach made good on their promise (threat) to rename every north-south minor street to “Lane”, so now I live on Sims Lane nee Sims Street. One of my conspiracy theories was that this was a way to get stimulus money, but they just taped over the “St” portion of the signs with “Ln”, so if federal moolah&nbsp; is involved, then they’re not working very hard for it.

I think the real mundane reason for this change is that someone thought it just sounded better. The city officials pushing for the change said it’s required to remove inconsistencies in various street databases that pose a public safety issue (aren’t you actually introducing inconsistencies?)&nbsp; Well, it’s really to conform to an old city specification that north-south streets be named lane (what about all the curved and diagonal and L-shaped streets in my neighborhood?). And every other city has similar specifications (they all have the same convention?).&nbsp; And if we need help from the Long Beach fire department, they’ll be confused if we don’t have this street naming convention (again, they all have the same convention? and isn’t it more confusing that we change street names running from outside into our city?) And these specifications are necessary for the computerized dispatch systems to work (you’re kidding, the computer actually cares if a street is named Lane or Street) And don’t worry about your mail, the post office computer system doesn’t care about street suffixes (well, the fire department should use their computer). The specification is really needed for public safety new hires who aren’t familiar with the city (so you were making up that stuff about the computer?) And you can change your financial information gradually over time (thanks!).

Watching the city council meeting where this was discussed and just about rubber stamped (no discussion of cost or how it would be executed), I thought, these guys really, really want this change. It reminded me of all of my workplaces where management made a fuss over coding style conventions and just said all kinds of stuff to justify it. It’s really important for code safety. It’s important for new hires or others visiting the code. Every company has a convention. It’s not bad, you’ll get used to it. So someone goes through and changes everyone’s code and introduces bugs, and I still end up looking at three-page long functions making improper use of the language and API’s. But it must be good code, because it’s following a coding convention. And it’s got design patterns (coding conventions masquerading as software architecture). And from that point on, I don’t believe anything more from the powers that be, since they made a fuss about this instead of focusing on important matters&nbsp; (there’s a coding style guidebook behind every worthless startup stock certificate on my wall). Same with my civic leaders - next time I watch a city council meeting, I’ll be sure to disbelieve everything they say.
