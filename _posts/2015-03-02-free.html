My rating: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1192487915">3 of 5 stars</a><br/><br/>
Like the author&rsquo;s well-known book The Long Tail, I felt this topic would have been fine as a Wired article but was artificially stretched to fill out a book, citing anything remotely related to free, even includin the term &ldquo;free lunch&rdquo; as an example, and like other works of this ilk, breathlessly extolling the new world order while understating the challenges this poses to those who reside in the &ldquo;long tail.&rdquo; Ironically, I found this book in the bargain section of Office Depot.
