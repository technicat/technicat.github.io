Periodically I receive emails asking me to link to some scammy college resource site, but this one is pretty funny - itâ€™s asking for a link on my old Lisp programming resources page:

> Hi Webmaster, I designed a speech pathology resource guide for students called [http://onlinespeechpathologyprograms.net](http://onlinespeechpathologyprograms.net). There are not near enough online speech pathology programs within the school system, so I wanted to reach out to you to help spread the word about getting a speech pathology degree. I created my speech education site to help show students the various school programs that students can choose from. I list everything thing you need to know about what it takes to get a Speech Pathology degree! As you have a related site, would you mind helping me to connect students with my site by adding it to your resources page of [http://drupal.technicat.com/open/lisp.html](http://drupal.technicat.com/open/lisp.html) ? Thank you so much for your time and any effort to add my link to your page would be appreciated! Best Regards, Adam C. PO Box 1531 Houston, TX 77219 Unsubscribe: collegeunsubscribe.com
