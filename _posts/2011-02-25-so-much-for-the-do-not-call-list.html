<p>I wasn&rsquo;t bluffing - after getting a telemarketing call from Time Warner two nights ago, I marched (well, drove and sauntered) down to the TW retail store to return my cable model and cancel my Roadrunner service. I figured, righteousness aside, I&rsquo;m in between contracts, and my standard operating procedure is to stock up on instant ramen and canned soup, and cut out recurring costs, like the $50/month for cable broadband.</p>

<p>However, that didn&rsquo;t stop TWC from calling me again that very evening. Now even if I wasn&rsquo;t on their do-not-call list, it seems pretty silly to call me two nights in a row. Perhaps they though I had a change of heart overnight? Anyway, the guy seemed nervous so I let him rattle off his spiel (I also do that when the caller is a woman with a sexy voice - telemarketing strategists take note), and then I asked him how I could stop them from calling me &ldquo;once and for all&rdquo;. Like the previous caller, he just recited their official mantra - &ldquo;Time Warner takes do not call requests seriously&rdquo; (obviously, they don&rsquo;t) - and that he would put me on the list. When I protested that I&rsquo;d asked to be on that list for the last three years, he said &ldquo;I&rsquo;m just reading you want I&rsquo;m allowed to&rdquo;. But then I went a step farther than usual and called customer service to confirm if I&rsquo;m on their do-not-call list, and the rep there did. But when I asked why I&rsquo;m still getting call, all he had to say was the blatantly obvious, &ldquo;you shouldn&rsquo;t be getting those calls&rdquo;, (at least it was a step up from the blatantly untrue) and that he was going to update my do-not-call entry (to what, &ldquo;do not call, and he really means it?&rdquo;).</p>

<p>So it wasn&rsquo;t a total waste of time - if they call again, I&rsquo;ll state that I&rsquo;m already on the do-not-call list so why are they calling me (and none of that, oh, it takes 30 days for that list to take affect). And I verified that my replacement Samsung Vibrant phone worked before I sent back the old one.</p>
