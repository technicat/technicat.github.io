<p>When I listed <a href="http://www.fugugames.com/">Fugu Games</a> on the Dreamhost Site of the Month forum (garnering an average of 2 points out of  10), one reviewer asked :&ldquo;What&rsquo;s a Fugu?&rdquo;. It seems to me it would have been faster to just type &ldquo;fugu&rdquo; in the browser search box, but a fugu is the poisonous Japanese puffer fish served as a delicacy. Some of you may recall the <a href="http://www.videosift.com/video/The-Simpsons-Go-To-A-Sushi-Restaurant-Homer-eats-Fugu">Simpsons episode</a>. See the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fugu">wikipedia article</a> for more information.</p>

<p>I came up with the name a few years ago after watching a segment on fugu on the <a href="http://www.foodnetwork.com/">Food Network</a>. Tasty, with a hint of danger - perfect name for a game company!</p>
