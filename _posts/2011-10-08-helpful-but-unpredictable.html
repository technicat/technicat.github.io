<p>I never hear about Earthlink anymore, but they&rsquo;re still around, apparently&hellip;</p>

<p><em>Originally written on Epinions in May 2003:</em></p>

<p>Earthlink is like your corporate IT guy. Seems like he&rsquo;s loafing around for long stretches of time, then he puts in a great upgrade of your network, but your login has been reset and your files have been moved somewhere.</p>

<p>Fortunately, these people aren&rsquo;t as annoying as the surly IT character on SNL (bring him back!) I&rsquo;ve been using the Earthlink Starter Site web hosting package since 1997, and the tech support has been consistently good. The person at the other end of my phone calls or email has in every instance been obviously knowledgable and efficient at resolving my case.</p>

<p>However, in the past few years I&rsquo;ve felt disenchanted after experiencing longer phone support hold times, bounce arounds (&ldquo;This is billing, you need tech support&rdquo; &ldquo;This is tech support, you need billing&rdquo;), and a dysfunctional online account administration (I&rsquo;ve had to enter the same change of address several times before asking tech support to do it).</p>

<p>And my web hosting package had some annoying limitations. For example, the domain email addresses were mapped to earthlink email addresses, so I could only choose names not selected by any other earthlink customer. Any misspellings or addresses like &ldquo;webmaster@mydomain&rdquo; would never reach me, or worse yet, go to someone else. Note, this limitation may be specific to the Starter Site package.</p>

<p>But Earthlink did increase my web space from 20MB to 100MB a couple of years ago, and just recently they have provided their web hosting customers with a web-based site administration tool. Not only have they separated the domain email mailboxes from the earthlink mail, the admin tool allows you to create up to a hundred email addresses, with optional forwarding instructions for each, and ten mail lists.</p>

<p>The admin tool has an interface for creating/editing/uploading web pages and installing add-ons, such as hit counters and forums. The resulting forum is too simplistic for my taste, but you are allowed to upload perl scripts.</p>

<p>So far, I&rsquo;m very pleased with the new functionality in my Starter Site package, and I think it&rsquo;s a good deal at the $20/month that I&rsquo;ve been paying from the beginning (I assume that hasn&rsquo;t changed, but I haven&rsquo;t received my next bill, yet). I&rsquo;m paying an additional $10/month for limited hours of dialup access - it was a requirement when I signed up, but I may look into removing the dialup subscription, as I&rsquo;m using a separate DSL provider.</p>

<p>The upgrade was not without a hitch. I received an email notice that the upgrade would proceed within the next 36 hours, and then the next day I realized I wasn&rsquo;t receiving any more email. I got a warm body on the line with only a couple minutes wait, possibly because they list a separate phone support number for web hosting, and the tech support person deduced quickly that my mailbox had been deactivated and the email was routed into a new default admin mailbox for my domain.</p>

<p>The good news is that The Mystery of the Missing Mail was resolved in minutes - the bad news is that it happened at all. What if I was a small business owner or independent consultant reliant on this email? Oh, wait, I am.</p>

<p>But I can&rsquo;t stay mad at these guys. Shortly after my tech support call, they sent me a short satisfaction questionnaire about the call, so it seems they are trying to do right, and I&rsquo;m impressed that their tech support people know more about my browser than I do. I dumped my Earthlink stock a few years ago when I thought they were losing their touch, but now I&rsquo;m thinking of buying in, again. The dot-com crash is over, right?</p>
