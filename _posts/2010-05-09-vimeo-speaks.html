<p>A while back, Goodreads changed their Terms of Service to include one of those all-encompassing indemnification clauses that I detest. When I complained about it on one of the Goodreads groups, a member asked me to explain the issue &ldquo;in layman&rsquo;s terms&rdquo;. Now, that&rsquo;s a problem if web site users are implicitly agreeing to a contract without the ability to understand it.</p>

<p>Some sites don&rsquo;t have this broad indemnification clause, e.g. Twitter, Facebook and last I checked, TripAdvisor (this clause is particularly disquieting on a site that relies on user-written reviews, so it&rsquo;s disappointing that Goodreads has it - what if someone sues Goodreads because they don&rsquo;t like a book review you wrote? Don&rsquo;t laugh - it happens on Tripadvisor)</p>

<p>I can mostly avoid sites with that indemnification clause (I stuck with Goodreads, but limit myself to just rating rather than reviewing books). It&rsquo;s hard to avoid using Google, though, which uses this clause on everything including YouTube. So I was hoping that Vimeo had something better, especially since I just noticed that Vimeo now works on the iPhone and iPad. My  hopes are dashed, but they deserve kudos for putting a &ldquo;Vimeo Speaks&rdquo; column of explanatory text alongside the TOS legalese. Here&rsquo;s their indemnification clause in &ldquo;layman&rsquo;s terms&rdquo;:<br/><a href="http://itshardtofondlepenguins.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/Screen-shot-2010-05-09-at-12.16.33-AM.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3425" title="Screen shot 2010-05-09 at 12.16.33 AM" src="http://itshardtofondlepenguins.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/Screen-shot-2010-05-09-at-12.16.33-AM.png" alt="" width="324" height="166"/></a></p>
