<p>My enthusiasm over the mobile hotspot feature on my Samsung Vibrant phone has diminished, after I received a text message from T-Mobile today saying &ldquo;Due to your high data usage this billing cycle, your data speed will be reduced for the remainder of this billing cycle.&rdquo; So much for my &ldquo;unlimited data plan&rdquo;. I guess I shouldn&rsquo;t have tried downloading XCode with it.</p>
