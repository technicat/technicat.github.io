<p>When I purchased Xamarin (or rented, as it&rsquo;s a subscription) last year, I had visions of cross-platform mobile development, like Unity, but for application apps (app-apps?)</p>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t get very far last year, just trying out some sample Android apps, partly the cross-platform aspect really only encompassed any reusable non-UI code, as Xamarin uses the native platform UI. Xamarin Forms, introduced just a few months ago, is intended to take care of that, providing a cross-platform way to create the UI. But it&rsquo;s pretty new, so I wasn&rsquo;t surprised I ran into stumbling blocks like being unable to build a sample app after moving it, and unable to build an Android version of an app although the iOS version worked fine.</p>

<p>But, finally, after the latest Xamarin update, success! I was able to build both the Android and iOS versions of a sample tip calculator and deploy them on Google Play and the App Store (under the name Fugu Tips). It&rsquo;s not the most exciting app, especially after mostly with Unity games the last several years, but it works (and it works better than some, like that one I found which displays NaN in some situations!)</p>

<p>Anyway, now it&rsquo;s time to start messing with it. I&rsquo;ve got a few ideas, like some feedback on your generosity (a resounding boo! if you drag that slider too low), or some presets in addition to the slider, or even some geolocation-based help on tipping properly in other areas of the world (it&rsquo;ll be easy in some Asian countries - a big fat zero).</p>
