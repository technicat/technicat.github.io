<p>While reading the review of the latest 3D Studio Max in Game Developer magazine, it occurred to me the new Max look is similar to the new Pro look introduced in Unity 3. Which prompts this prediction: Autodesk will buy Unity. It&rsquo;s not much of a prediction - not like I have any money down on it (and I&rsquo;m sure there&rsquo;s a long thread on this somewhere on the Unity forum). But besides the suspiciously similar look, consider Unity relies on the FBX SDK, recently incorporated the Beast lightmapping tool, which is now owned by Autodesk, and Autodesk is missing an actual game engine in its suite of game-related products. And the web player is an opportunity to get into the web space and complement their game business with online games (and I&rsquo;m sure everyone has looked enviously on Adobe&rsquo;s dominance in that space so far).</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not sure how I&rsquo;d feel about it - seems to me that game companies don&rsquo;t do as well after getting acquired by non-game companies (and middleware aside, I wouldn&rsquo;t go as far as to call Autodesk a game company). And I&rsquo;d like to see Unity expand their content-creation support to more vendors, which would be less likely if they&rsquo;re owned by a content creation tool vendor. But it might help in some areas, for example establishing the web player as a de-facto standard.</p>
