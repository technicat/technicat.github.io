Developing and publishing apps and games, principally [Talk Dim Sum](talkdimsum) on the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/talk-dim-sum/id953929066), and [HyperBowl](hyperbowl) on the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/hyperbowl/id344209253?ign-mpt=uo%3D8), [Itch.io](https://technicat.itch.io/hyperbowl), and [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/847530/HyperBowl/).

For fun: various little [Fugu Games](https://technicat.itch.io/) are also on Itch.io, and [processing pi](processing-pi). Some source (and these webpages) are on [Github](http://github.com/technicat). Also, check out all our old [logos](logos).

Current client projects include [Cinefex iPad Edition](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/cinefex/id512379220).

Previous work is listed on my latest resume in [JSON](resume). An old one in [XMl](resumexml) is still hanging around, and for fun, an animated one in [WebGL](resumewgl), (borrowed from [Ben Gibbons](https://bgibbonsweb.github.io/webgl/resume.html)).

I've also written [Learn Unity 4 for iOS Game Development](learnunity) published by Apress (obsolete but still in print), and self-published [Technicat on Software](technicat-on-software).
