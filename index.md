Developing and publishing apps and games. [Talk Dim Sum](talkdimsum) is on the App Store, [HyperBowl](hyperbowl) is on the App Store, Itch.io, and Steam.

Client work includes Cinefex iPad Edition on the App Store.

Previous work is listed on my latest resume in [JSON](resume). An old one in [XMl)(resumexml) is still hanging around, and for fun, an animated on in borrowed [WebGL](resumewgl).

I've also written [Learn Unity 4 for iOS Game Development](learnunity4) published by Apress (obsolete but still in print), and self-published [Technicat on Software](technicat-on-software).
