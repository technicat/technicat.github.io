## Previous Work

My latest resume in [JSON](resume). An old one in [XML](resumexml) is still hanging around, and for fun, an animated one in [WebGL](resumewgl), (borrowed from [Ben Gibbons](https://bgibbonsweb.github.io/webgl/resume.html)).

[HomeTeam GameDev](https://hometeamgamedev.com/) interviewed me for their [podcast](https://gamedevslikeyou.libsyn.com/phil-chu). I also presented some [slides](gamedev-slides) to a game development class taught by [Pam Lipson](https://www.technologyreview.com/innovator/pamela-lipson/).

I've written [Learn Unity 4 for iOS Game Development](learnunity), published by Apress (obsolete but still in print), and self-published (and un-published) [Technicat on Software](technicat-on-software).

## For Fun

Various little [Fugu Games](https://technicat.itch.io/) (check out these old [logos](logos)), and [processing pi](processing-pi).

Many of these projects, and these webpages, are on [Github](http://github.com/technicat).
