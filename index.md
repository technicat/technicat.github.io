## Past Projects

My latest [résumé](resume) in [JSON](http://jsonresume.org/) lists past projects. An old one in [XML](resumexml) is still hanging around, and for fun, an animated one in [WebGL](resumewgl), (borrowed from [Ben Gibbons](https://bgibbonsweb.github.io/webgl/resume.html)).

[HomeTeam GameDev](https://hometeamgamedev.com/) interviewed me for their [podcast](https://gamedevslikeyou.libsyn.com/phil-chu). I also presented some [slides](gamedev-slides) to a game development class taught by [Pam Lipson](https://www.technologyreview.com/innovator/pamela-lipson/).

I wrote [Learn Unity 4 for iOS Game Development](learnunity), published by [Apress](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-1-4302-4876-7) (obsolete but still in print), and self-published (and un-published) [Technicat on Software](technicat-on-software).

## For Fun

Various little [Fugu Games](https://technicat.itch.io/) (check out these old [logos](logos)) and playing around with tools, like [processing pi](processing-pi) and [Ask an Asian American](aaaa).

Many of these projects, and these webpages, are on [Github](http://github.com/technicat).
