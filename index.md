Developing and publishing apps and games, principally [Talk Dim Sum](talkdimsum) on the App Store, and [HyperBowl](hyperbowl) on the App Store, [Itch.io](https://technicat.itch.io/hyperbowl), and [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/847530/HyperBowl/).

Client work includes [Cinefex iPad Edition](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/cinefex/id512379220).

Previous work is listed on my latest resume in [JSON](resume). An old one in [XMl](resumexml) is still hanging around, and for fun, an animated on in borrowed [WebGL](resumewgl).

I've also written [Learn Unity 4 for iOS Game Development](learnunity4) published by Apress (obsolete but still in print), and self-published [Technicat on Software](technicat-on-software).
